<p>“Necessity is the mother of invention”: and it was the constant worry, of never having ready to hand, when one wanted it, a postage-stamp of the right value for a letter or parcel, which drove me to invent my “Wonderland Postage-Stamp Case,” which contains twelve pockets, marked for stamps of various values, and two Coloured Pictorial Surprises from “Alice in Wonderland.” It is accompanied with a small book, <a href="../texts/eight-or-nine-wise-words-about-letter-writing.html">“Eight or Nine Wise Words about Letter-Writing.”</a> The price is 1s., but, if it be ordered by post, additional payment will be required to cover postage, as follows:—One copy 1-1/2d.; two or three, 2d.; four, 2-1/2d.; five to fourteen, 3d.; and every subsequent fourteen, 1-1/2d. The publishers are Messrs.&nbsp;Emberlin and Son, 4, Magdalen Street, Oxford.</p>
