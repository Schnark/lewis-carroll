<p class="subtitle">To the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Editor</span> of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">St.&nbsp;James’s Gazette</span></p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir</span>,—Most reluctantly do I seek to trespass on your space with another personal matter. Some remarks of mine, relative to the well-known Mr.&nbsp;John Smith, have probably attracted your notice, having been widely repeated in the best circles. These were to the effect that he has committed several burglaries and forged two cheques for large amounts. Similar publicity has, unfortunately, been given to Mr.&nbsp;William Brown’s assertion that my statements “were fabrications.”</p>

<p>May I be allowed to say, once for all, that, some months ago, when Mr.&nbsp;Brown made a similar charge against me, I challenged him to produce any one statement which I have ever made about Mr.&nbsp;John Smith, and prove it to be false.</p>

<p>To this challenge he made no reply, except to mutter some wretched Latin jargon about “onus probandi.” I leave the public to judge where the fabrication lies.—I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
