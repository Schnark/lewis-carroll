<h2>For All Lovers of Children</h2>
<p>Source: The Lady, March 24, March 31 (both with minor differences as noted), April 14, April 28, May 12, May 19, May 26, 1892 (as part of the Syzygy column)</p></header>
<article>

<p>When I brought out, in 1890, “<i>The Nursery Alice</i>” (a thin 4to book, containing 20 coloured enlargements of Tenniel’s illustrations to “Alice in Wonderland,” with text adapted to very young children, and with a coloured picture-cover, designed by Miss E. G. Thomson), the colours, in the first impression, came out rather brighter than I liked. The second impression was exactly right; and these are now on sale, at 4s. each. I am selling off the over-bright ones, as a “People’s Edition,” at 2s. each (which scarcely covers the cost of production), as long as they last: when they are exhausted, no more can be supplied at so cheap a rate. If not quite artistic enough for your own children, you will find them well suited to give to invalid children among the poor. <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-1">I shall be very glad to receive the addresses of any Hospitals, or Homes, for Sick Children, where the funds are not adequate for buying them books, and where I have not already presented copies of the various “Alice” books: my present list contains the addresses of 134 such Institutions, whose wants I have already supplied.</span> The publishers are Messrs.&nbsp;Macmillan and Co., 29, Bedford Street, Strand.</p>
