<p class="subtitle">To the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Editor</span> of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">St.&nbsp;James’s Gazette</span></p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir</span>,—Will you kindly grant me space, in your columns, to ask if any clergyman, who takes in the <i>Guardian</i>, would bestow his copy, when done with, on my brother, the Rev.&nbsp;E. H. Dodgson, who is “Priest in Charge” in the lonely island of Tristan d’Acunha, 1,200 miles from the nearest land—S.&nbsp;Helena. Communications between S.&nbsp;Helena and Tristan are “few and far between,” and my brother lives almost as if in another planet, so little does he hear of what goes on in the busy world he has left in order to devote himself to the spiritual needs of these poor islanders. When any vessel does go, it of course takes whatever letters etc. have accumulated for him at S.&nbsp;Helena: and a batch of old <i>Guardians</i> would be very welcome to him, even if months old when they reach him.</p>

<p>If any brother-priest will do him this service, I shall be grateful for a line, addressed to me at Oxford, that I may arrange with him as to where, and when, the papers should be sent.—I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
