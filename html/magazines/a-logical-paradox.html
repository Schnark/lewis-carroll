<p>“What, <i>nothing</i> to do?” said Uncle Jim. “Then come along with me down to Allen’s. And you can just take a turn while I get myself shaved.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Uncle Joe. “And the Cub had better come too, I suppose?”</p>

<p>The “Cub” was <i>me</i>, as the reader will perhaps have guessed for himself. I’m turned <i>fifteen</i>—more than three months ago; but there’s no sort of use in mentioning <i>that</i> to Uncle Joe; he’d only say “Go to your cubbicle, little boy!” or “Then I suppose you can do cubbic equations?” or some equally vile pun. He asked me yesterday to give him an instance of a Proposition in <i>A</i>. And I said “All uncles make vile puns”. And I don’t think he liked it. However, that’s neither here nor there. I was glad enough to go. I <i>do</i> love hearing those uncles of mine “chop logic,” as they call it; and they’re desperate hands at it, <i>I</i> can tell you!</p>

<p>“That is not a logical inference from my remark,” said Uncle Jim.</p>

<p>“Never said it was,” said Uncle Joe: “it’s a <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i>”.</p>

<p>“An <i>Illicit Process of the Minor!</i>” chuckled Uncle Jim.</p>

<p>That’s the sort of way they always go on, whenever <i>I’m</i> with them. As if there was any fun in calling me a Minor!</p>

<p>After a bit, Uncle Jim began again, just as we came in sight of the barber’s. “I only hope <i>Carr</i> will be at home,” he said. “Brown’s so clumsy. And Allen’s hand has been shaky ever since he had that fever.”</p>

<p>“Carr’s <i>certain</i> to be in,” said Uncle Joe.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you sixpence he <i>isn’t!</i>” said I.</p>

<p>“Keep your bets for your betters,” said Uncle Joe. “I mean”—he hurried on, seeing by the grin on my face what a slip he’d made—“I mean that I can <i>prove</i> it, logically. It isn’t a matter of <i>chance</i>.”</p>

<p>“Prove it <i>logically!</i>” sneered Uncle Jim. “Fire away, then! I defy you to do it!”</p>

<p>“For the sake of argument,” Uncle Joe began, “let us assume Carr to be <i>out</i>. And let us see what that assumption would lead to. I’m going to do this by <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i>.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are!” growled Uncle Jim. “Never knew any argument of <i>yours</i> that didn’t end in some absurdity or other!”</p>

<p>“Unprovoked by your unmanly taunts,” said Uncle Joe in a lofty tone, “I proceed. Carr being out, you will grant that, if Allen is <i>also</i> out, <i>Brown</i> must be at home?”</p>

<p>“What’s the good of <i>his</i> being at home?” said Uncle Jim. “I don’t want <i>Brown</i> to shave me! He’s too clumsy.”</p>

<p>“Patience is one of those inestimable qualities——” Uncle Joe was beginning; but Uncle Jim cut him off short.</p>

<p>“<i>Argue!</i>” he said. “Don’t <i>moralise!</i>”</p>

<p>“Well, but <i>do</i> you grant it?” Uncle Joe persisted. “Do you grant me that, if Carr is out, it follows that if Allen is out Brown <i>must</i> be in?”</p>

<p>“Of course he must,” said Uncle Jim; “or there’d be nobody to mind the shop.”</p>

<p>“We see, then, that the absence of Carr brings into play a certain Hypothetical, whose <i>protasis</i> is ‘Allen is out,’ and whose <i>apodosis</i> is ‘Brown is in’. And we see that, so long as Carr remains out, this Hypothetical remains in force?”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose it does. What then?” said Uncle Jim.</p>

<p>“You will also grant me that the truth of a Hypothetical—I mean its <i>validity</i> as a logical <i>sequence</i>—does not in the least depend on its <i>protasis</i> being actually <i>true</i>, nor even on its being <i>possible</i>. The Hypothetical ‘If you were to run from here to London in five minutes you would surprise people,’ remains true as a <i>sequence</i>, whether you can do it or not.”</p>

<p>“I <i>ca’n’t</i> do it,” said Uncle Jim.</p>

<p>“We have now to consider <i>another</i> Hypothetical. What was that you told me yesterday about Allen?”</p>

<p>“I told you,” said Uncle Jim, “that ever since he had that fever he’s been so nervous about going out alone, he always takes Brown with him.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said Uncle Joe. “Then the Hypothetical ‘if Allen is out Brown is out’ is <i>always</i> in force, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Uncle Jim. (He seemed to be getting a little nervous, himself, now.)</p>

<p>“Then, if Carr is out, we have <i>two</i> Hypotheticals, ‘if Allen is out Brown is <i>in</i>’ and ‘If Allen is out Brown is <i>out</i>,’ in force at once. And two <i>incompatible</i> Hypotheticals, mark you! They ca’n’t <i>possibly</i> be true together!”</p>

<p>“<i>Ca’n’t</i> they?” said Uncle Jim.</p>

<p>“How <i>can</i> they?” said Uncle Joe. “How <i>can</i> one and the same <i>protasis</i> prove two contradictory <i>apodoses?</i> You grant that the two <i>apodoses</i>, ‘Brown is <i>in</i>’ and ‘Brown is <i>out</i>,’ are contradictory, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I grant <i>that</i>,” said Uncle Jim.</p>

<p>“Then I may sum up,” said Uncle Joe. “If Carr is out, these two Hypotheticals are true together. And we know that they <i>cannot</i> be true together. Which is absurd. Therefore Carr <i>cannot</i> be out. There’s a nice <i>Reductio ad Absurdum</i> for you!”</p>

<p>Uncle Jim looked thoroughly puzzled; but after a bit he plucked up courage, and began again. “I don’t feel at all clear about that <i>incompatibility</i>. Why shouldn’t those two Hypotheticals be true together? It seems to me that would simply prove ‘<i>Allen</i> is in’. Of course, it’s clear that the <i>apodoses</i> of those two Hypotheticals are incompatible—‘Brown is in’ and ‘Brown is out’. But why shouldn’t we put it like this? If Allen is out Brown is <i>out</i>. If Carr and Allen are <i>both</i> out, Brown is <i>in</i>. Which is absurd. Therefore Carr and Allen ca’n’t be <i>both</i> of them out. But, so long as Allen is <i>in</i>, I don’t see what’s to hinder Carr from going <i>out</i>.”</p>

<p>“My dear, but most illogical, brother!” said Uncle Joe. (Whenever Uncle Joe begins to “dear” you, you may make pretty sure he’s got you in a cleft stick!) “Don’t you see that you are wrongly dividing the <i>protasis</i> and the <i>apodosis</i> of that Hypothetical? Its <i>protasis</i> is simply ‘Carr is out’; and its <i>apodosis</i> is a sort of sub-Hypothetical, ‘If Allen is out, Brown is <i>in</i>’. And a most absurd apodosis it is, being hopelessly incompatible with that other Hypothetical, that we know is <i>always</i> true, ‘If Allen is out, Brown is <i>out</i>’. And it’s simply the assumption ‘Carr is out’ that has caused this absurdity. So there’s only <i>one</i> possible conclusion. <i>Carr is in!</i>”</p>

<p>How long this argument <i>might</i> have lasted, I haven’t the least idea. I believe <i>either</i> of them could argue for six hours at a stretch. But, just at this moment, we arrived at the barber’s shop; and, on going inside, we found——</p>

<h3>Note</h3>
<p>The paradox, of which the foregoing paper is an ornamental presentment, is, I have reason to believe, a very real difficulty in the Theory of Hypotheticals. The disputed point has been for some time under discussion by several practised logicians, to whom I have submitted it; and the various and conflicting opinions, which my correspondence with them has elicited, convince me that the subject needs further consideration, in order that logical teachers and writers may come to some agreement as to what Hypotheticals <i>are</i>, and how they ought to be treated.</p>

<p>The original dispute, which arose, more than a year ago, between two students of Logic, may be symbolically represented as follows:—</p>

<p>There are two Propositions, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>It is given that<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>(1) If <i>C</i> is true, then, if <i>A</i> is true, <i>B</i> is not true;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>(2) If <i>A</i> is true, <i>B</i> is true.</p>

<p>The question is, can <i>C</i> be true?</p>

<p>The reader will see that if, in these two Propositions, we replace the letters, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i> by the names Allen, Brown, Carr, and the words “true” and “not true” by the words “out” and “in” we get<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>(1) If Carr is out, then, if Allen is out, Brown is in;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>(2) If Allen is out, Brown is out.</p>

<p>These are the very two Propositions on which “Uncle Joe” builds his argument.</p>

<p>Several very interesting questions suggest themselves in connexion with this point, such as</p>

<p>Can a Hypothetical, whose protasis is false, be regarded as legitimate?</p>

<p>Are two Hypotheticals, of the forms “If <i>A</i> then <i>B</i>” and “If <i>A</i> then not-<i>B</i>,” compatible?</p>

<p>What difference in meaning, if any, exists between the following Propositions?<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>(1) <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, cannot be all true at once;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>(2) If <i>C</i> and <i>A</i> are true, <i>B</i> is not true;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>(3) If <i>C</i> is true, then, if <i>A</i> is true, <i>B</i> is not true;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>(4) If <i>A</i> is true, then, if <i>C</i> is true, <i>B</i> is not true.</p>

<p>The following concrete form of the paradox has just been sent me, and may perhaps, as embodying <i>necessary</i> truth, throw fresh light on the question.</p>

<p>Let there be three lines, <math><mrow><mi>K</mi><mi>L</mi></mrow></math>, <math><mrow><mi>L</mi><mi>M</mi></mrow></math>, <math><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>N</mi></mrow></math>, forming, at <var>L</var> and <var>M</var>, equal acute angles on the same side of <math><mrow><mi>L</mi><mi>M</mi></mrow></math>.</p>

<p>Let “<i>A</i>” mean “The points <var>K</var> and <var>N</var> coincide, so that the three lines form a triangle”.</p>

<p>Let “<i>B</i>” mean “The triangle has equal base-angles”.</p>

<p>Let “<i>C</i>” mean “The lines <math><mrow><mi>K</mi><mi>L</mi></mrow></math> and <math><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>N</mi></mrow></math> are unequal”.</p>

<p>Then we have<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>(1) If <i>C</i> is true, then, if <i>A</i> is true, <i>B</i> is not true;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>(2) If <i>A</i> is true, <i>B</i> is true.</p>

<p>The second of these Propositions needs no proof; and the first is proved in Euc., i, 6, though of course it may be questioned whether it fairly represents Euclid’s meaning.</p>

<p>I greatly hope that some of the readers of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mind</span> who take an interest in logic will assist in clearing up these curious difficulties.</p>
