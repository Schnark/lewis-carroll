<p class="subtitle">To the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Editor</span> of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">St.&nbsp;James’s Gazette</span></p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir</span>,—You will, I believe, be doing a kindness to many readers of this book, who have found difficulties, unforeseen by me, in the sudden changes of scene, and the introduction into real life of what they suppose to be “dream-children,” if you will allow me space to explain that the book is written on the theory of the actual existence of fairies, and of their being able to assume human form. The “I” of the story goes through three different stages of being, (1)&nbsp;real life, (2)&nbsp;the “eerie” stage, in which he can see fairies, (3)&nbsp;trance, in which, while his body remains apparently asleep, his spirit is free to pass into fairyland and witness what is going on there at the moment. There are no “dreams” in the book: the many imitations, that have appeared, of my two “dream-stories,” have effectually barred me from any further attempt to write fiction of that kind.—I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
