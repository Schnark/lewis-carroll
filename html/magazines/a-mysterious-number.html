<p>The number 142,857 does not at first sight appear to have anything odd about it, yet there are some strange things about it.</p>

<p>Let us multiply it by the numbers 2 to 7 and see the result.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>142,857 by 2 is 285,714.<br>
142,857 by 3 is 428,571.<br>
142,857 by 4 is 571,428.<br>
142,857 by 5 is 714,285.<br>
142,857 by 6 is 857,142.<br>
142,857 by 7 is 999,999.
</p></div>

<p>The first five products, you will observe, are composed not only of the same figures, but of the same figures in the same order, though beginning with a different figure each time. And the strangest part of it all is that 142,857 multiplied by 7 is 999,999, but after that point the products lose their oddity.</p>
