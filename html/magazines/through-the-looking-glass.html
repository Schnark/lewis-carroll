<h3 id="times:looking-glass-1">1893</h3>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Lewis Carroll, after having for over 25 years made it his chief object with regard to his books that they should be of the best workmanship attainable at the price is deeply annoyed to find that the last issue of “Through the Looking-glass,” consisting of the Sixtieth Thousand, has been put on sale without its being noticed that most of the pictures have failed so much in the printing as to make the book not worth buying. He requests all holders of copies to send them to Messrs.&nbsp;Macmillan and Co., 29,&nbsp;Bedford-street, Covent-garden, with their names and addresses, and copies of the next issue shall be sent them in exchange. Instead, however, of destroying the unsold copies, he proposes to utilise them by giving them away to mechanics’ institutes, village school libraries, and similar institutions, where the means for purchasing such books are scanty. Accordingly, he invites applications for such gifts, addressed to him, “care of Messrs.&nbsp;Macmillan.” Every such application should be signed by some responsible person, and should state how far they are able to buy books for themselves, and what is their average number of readers. He takes this opportunity of announcing that, if, at any future time, he should wish to communicate anything to his readers, he will do so by advertising in the “Agony” Column of some of the daily papers on the first Tuesday in the month.</p>

<h3 id="times:looking-glass-2">1894</h3>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Lewis Carroll advertised on Dec.&nbsp;2, 1893, that the sixtieth thousand was withdrawn from sale, as some of the pictures had failed in the printing, and that he would present them to mechanics’ institutes, village reading rooms, &amp;c., on receiving applications, addressed 29.&nbsp;Bedford-street, Covent-garden, stating how far they are able to buy books for themselves and what is their avarage number of readers. He has received a great number of applications, but not enough to exhaust the supply. Many of the applicants have neglected to furnish the required information, and it will be necessary to send a circular to them and to get their replies before they can have copies. He takes this opportunity of giving his readers the rules for “Co-operative Backgammon,” which he thinks will prove a novel and interesting variety of the game. (1.) Each player throws three dice: with two he moves for himself, and with the third for his adversary. (2.) If no one of the three dice is available for the adversary, a player may use any two he likes: otherwise he is bound to leave, as third die, one which will be available for the adversary. If at any future time Mr.&nbsp;Carroll should wish to communicate anything to his readers, he will do so by advertising in the “Agony” column of some of the daily papers on the first Tuesday in the month.</p>
