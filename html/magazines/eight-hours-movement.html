<h2>Eight Hours Movement</h2>

<p class="subtitle">To the Editor of the Standard</p>

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir</span>,—Supposing it were the custom, in a certain town, to sell eggs in paper bags at so much per bag, and that a fierce dispute had arisen between the egg vendors and the public as to how many eggs each bag should be understood to contain, the vendors wishing to be allowed to make up smaller bags; and supposing the public were to say, “In future we will pay you so much per egg, and you can make up bags as you please,” would any ground remain for further dispute?</p>

<p>Supposing that employers of labour, when threatened with a “strike” in case they should decline to reduce the number of hours in a working day, were to reply, “In future we will pay you so much per hour, and you can make up days as you please,” it does appear to me—being, as I confess, an ignorant outsider—that the dispute would die out for want of a <i>raison d’être</i>, and that these disastrous strikes, inflicting such heavy loss on employers and employed alike, would become things of the past.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
