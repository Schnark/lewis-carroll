<p class="subtitle">By Charles L. Dodgson, M.A.</p>

<p>In the years 1885, 1886, there appeared in regard to a Solution of Quest.&nbsp;7695 (see Vol.&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">xliii.</span>, p.&nbsp;86, and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">xliv.</span>, p.&nbsp;24) a discussion about a difficulty in the Theory of Chances, of which the following question was treated as a typical example:—“A random point being taken on a given line, what is the chance of its coinciding with a previously assigned point?” On one side it was maintained that the chance is <i>absolute zero:</i> on the other side it was maintained, by myself and others, that it is some sort of <i>infinitesimal</i>, and <i>not</i> absolute zero. The arguments on both sides were fully stated, and my only excuse, for re-opening the discussion, is that I have a <i>new</i> view of the difficulty to offer to the supporters of the “absolute zero” theory.</p>

<p>I assume that both sides accept the following axioms:—(1) that no aggregate, however infinitely numerous, of <i>absolute zeroes</i> can constitute a <i>magnitude</i>, however infinitely small; (2) (an example of the preceding) that no aggregate, however infinitely numerous, of <i>points</i> can constitute any portion, however infinitely short, of a <i>line</i>; and hence (3) that, if the chance of a random point on a line coinciding with <i>a single selected point</i> be absolute zero, so also is its chance of coinciding with one or other of <i>a selected aggregate of points</i>, however infinitely numerous.</p>

<p>I now propose two questions:—</p>

<p>I. “A random point being taken on a given line, what is the chance of its dividing the line into two <i>commensurable</i> parts?” It seems clear that we are here dealing with <i>a selected aggregate of points</i>, since it is impossible to mark off any portion of the <i>line</i>, and to say “Wherever, in this portion, the random point shall fall, it will divide the whole line into two commensurable parts.” I assume, then, that my opponents would answer “It is <i>absolute zero</i>.”</p>

<p>II. “And what is its chance of dividing the line into two <i>incommensurable</i> parts?” Here again they must answer “It is <i>absolute zero</i>.”</p>

<p>And yet <i>one or other</i> of these two events <i>must</i> happen! Hence, the sum of the two chances must be mathematically represented by unity; that is, one or other (though we cannot say which) must be—not only “<i>something</i>,” not only a certain <i>infinitesimal</i>, of some inconceivably high order—but must actually reach, if not exceed, the <i>finite</i> value of <i>one-half!</i></p>
