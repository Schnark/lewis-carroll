<p class="subtitle">To the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Editor</span> of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">St.&nbsp;James’s Gazette</span></p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir</span>,—The dialogue, headed “Vivisection,” which appeared in your journal on March 13, hardly gave, as I venture to think, a complete view of the “pros and cons” of this difficult question. May I hope that the author of that clever <i>jeu d’esprit</i> will pardon the liberty I take in attempting a sequel to it, which might very well have occurred in the same house a few hours later?—I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

<div class="verse">
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Justice T.</span>: Oh, come in, Smith! So glad you’ll join us in a midnight cigar. Carver and I were just talking over the beating you’ve had at Oxford—“Science <i>versus</i> Sentiment” shall we call it? You don’t look the worse for it, though. Beating agrees with your constitution, I fancy!<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;John Smith, M.A.</span>: Well, perhaps we don’t know when we <i>are</i> beaten, as Napoleon said of us. There are more than 5000 members of Convocation, while those who voted were 10 short of the Number of the Beast. But the question is disposed of, I admit. It takes a bigger question than that to tear the Briton from his own fireside. It must be something that touches him in a more sensitive place than his heart!<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir Samuel Carver, F.R.C.S.</span>: And now it’s all over, don’t you think, between ourselves, it’s a little illiberal of you and your friends to anathematise a branch of Science which some of our best men will tell you has done real service to the human race?<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Smith</span>: Speaking for my party generally (of course there are individual exceptions), we don’t anathematise it.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir S.&nbsp;Carver</span>: Well, at any rate you did your best to put an end to it in <i>Oxford?</i><br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Smith</span> <i>(smiling)</i>: Most certainly not!<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Justice T.</span>: This is interesting. Do tell us, Smith, what it was you really wanted. I always fancied the papers exaggerated the thing. As they put it, you hadn’t a leg to stand on, moral or intellectual.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Smith</span>: I am quite aware of it. Morally, we are bigots: intellectually, idiots. We ignore all the good that Vivisection, properly conducted, is proved to have done. We desire to exclude it entirely from our University, or, failing that, at any rate to hamper it with restrictions beyond what the Legislature has thought sufficient.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Justice T.</span>: So the papers say.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Smith</span>: Yet, in fact, we fully recognise the good it has done. We do <i>not</i> plead for its total exclusion, but only that it shall not be used for mere teaching-purposes, and that for purposes of research it shall not be practised without anæsthetics.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir S.&nbsp;Carver</span>: I quite admit, with many of my scientific brethren, that it should not be used for teaching-purposes.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Justice T.</span>: And I beg to point out that you have a solemn promise, from the present Professor, that it shall not be so used.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Smith</span>: That of course would suffice during his tenure of office. We wished to have a security for the <i>future:</i> and I dare say, if we had asked no more than this, we might have got an enactment passed, embodying the Professor’s promise. The real bone of contention was that we wished it enacted that, even for purposes of research, the Oxford Professor should not perform painful experiments without anæsthetics.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir S.&nbsp;Carver</span>: I can assure you that, in my own practice, I <i>always</i> use anæsthetics, excepting when their use would nullify the experiment. Such cases are rare, but they do happen; for instance, in investigating the action of the nerves.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Smith</span>: I am not prepared to deny that cases may arise where the infliction of pain is justified by the importance of the object. But is it a very extravagant boon to ask that in a University whose function so largely consists in teaching the <i>young</i>, this one kind of vivisection should be omitted? There are many of us who do not think this kind of vivisection justified at all, and many, I should hope, of the young to whom the very thought that such things are done in the midst of us is a painful one. Is it quite outrageous to ask that their feelings should be spared this, so long as such research can be conducted in other places?<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Justice T.</span>: Oh, but your friends who call it unjustifiable are clearly out of court. They are setting up as better judges than the Legislature!<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Smith</span>: Madness, indeed! How could we hint that the Legislature is fallible? No scientific man has ever breathed a suspicion of its fallibility in the <i>other</i> direction, by too much restriction!<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir S.&nbsp;Carver</span>: There, I admit, you score one.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Justice T.</span>: But you’re not going to have it all your own way, my dear fellow! I wish you had been here in the evening, to hear some of the inconsistencies of your side. Fox-hunting, now. With all your fine feelings about giving pain, what right have you to go and see a fox hunted to death, merely for sport?<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Smith</span>: Personally, I claim no such right. All pain, inflicted for sport, is abhorrent to me. But I must allow that the question is a mixed one, as to <i>some</i> sport. Where, for instance, wild beasts have to be exterminated for the safety of man, it seems almost inevitable that the hunter should enjoy the excitement of the chase. But that is a totally different matter from keeping up the breed of some animals, such as foxes, for the sole purpose of sport. That I don’t justify for a moment.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Justice T.</span>: As to pigeon-shooting, now?<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Smith</span> (<i>warmly</i>): Utterly and entirely unjustifiable.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Justice T.</span>: But, as the ladies were saying just now, the dear Prince goes to Hurlingham!<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Smith</span>: The dear Princess doesn’t.<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir S.&nbsp;Carver</span>: Had you there, Judge! You can’t press the question of sport, unless your man’s a sportsman. But you are not a vegetarian, Smith, are you? I suppose you enjoy your turtle-soup, your veal-cutlet, your lobster-salad, as much as most men? Are you aware of the wanton cruelty that is practised in furnishing you with a dinner? Set the vivisectionists against the butchers, in the way of giving pain!<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Smith</span>: Not for one moment would I justify brutal cruelty in <i>any</i> one. But which is worst, think you, in the sight of God (who judges by the heart, not the outward act), the ignorant butcher, brought up from childhood to witness brutality and who has never fully realized what he is doing in torturing God’s creatures, or the educated and intelligent vivisectionist, who realizes to the last iota all the pain he is giving, and yet deliberately inflicts it for an unworthy object, some meaningless point of science, or perhaps merely to gratify his curiosity?<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Justice T.</span>: True enough. <i>Corruptio optimi pessima.</i><br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Smith</span>: And may I not turn the tables on <i>you</i> for a moment, dear Sir Samuel? When will you and your brother-physiologists take in hand this burning question (I hardly know whether, in this age of burning questions, there is <i>one</i> more vital than this), how to put an end to the heart-sickening cry, that rises from the whole brute-creation, that man, their masters, is needlessly torturing them for his own selfish ends? When will you teach us, in words that all may understand, the plain laws of physiology, so that our horses (for instance) may no longer suffer from bearing-reins, and blinkers, and over-driving? What fairer field of experiment could you desire than to ascertain some painless method for killing the creatures we need for food? Depend upon it, the first vivisectionist that does this for us, and lets us sit down to our meals with the certainty that no needless pain has been given in providing them, will have his reward, even in <i>this</i> life, if the blessings of thousands on thousands of grateful hearts be any sufficient reward; and in the great day of account it shall be said to him, <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-1">“inasmuch as thou hast done it to one of the least of these My creatures, thou hast done it unto Me”</span>!<br>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr.&nbsp;Justice T.</span>: You are getting excited, Smith. Allow me to suggest that it is time for bed.
