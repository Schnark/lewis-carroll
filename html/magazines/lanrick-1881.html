<p class="subtitle">A Game for Two Players. <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-1">Third</span> Edition</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-1">Second</aside>

<div class="motto"><p><span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-2">‘The muster-place be Lanrick-mead.’</span></p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-2"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>The Lady of the Lake</i> by Sir Walter Scott</aside></div>

<p>1. The game requires a chess-board, five white and five black men, and something, such as a coin, with which to mark a square. <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-3">The twenty-eight border-squares form ‘the border’: the other thirty-six form ‘the field.’</span></p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-3">(missing in second edition)</aside>

<p>2. The men are moved like chess-queens, that is, along any line of squares, straight or slanting.</p>

<p>3. The mark may be set on any <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-4">square in the field</span>. The marked square forms, with the surrounding eight, a ‘rendezvous,’ into which both Players try to get their men: it counts as a vacant square, so that a man may be moved into or over it.</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-4">but a border-square</aside>

<p>4. When playing for a rendezvous, he who plays first may not move in that turn more than two squares: in any other turn a Player may not move more squares than he has men on the board. He may move <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-5">all these squares</span> with one man, or may divide them among two or more men. He may move a man more than once in one turn, provided it be along the same line of squares.</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-5">them all</aside>

<p>5. He who begins sets on the border one of his men: the other does the same, and so on alternately. The Player named first in this Rule then sets the mark, taking care that none of his men are in the rendezvous, and that he cannot, in one turn, move them all in. Both then play for this rendezvous, he who did not set the mark playing first.</p>

<p>6. As soon as either Player has <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-6">‘won’ the rendezvous, <i>i.&thinsp;e.</i> has all his men in it,</span> he takes off the board <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-7">some one of his adversary’s men</span> who is not in, and moves to the border, <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-8">in accordance with</span> Rule 2, all <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-9">others of his adversary’s men who are not in and not already on the border</span>.</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-6">all his men in the rendezvous</aside>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-7">some man</aside>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-8">as in</aside>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-9">other men who are not in and not already on it</aside>

<p>7. Then, <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-10">if the Players have unequal numbers of men in the field, he who has most makes</span> the numbers equal by <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-11">moving to the border one or more of his men.</span></p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-10">if either Player has more men off the border than the other has, he makes</aside>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-11">moving men to the border</aside>

<p>8. Then he who has fewest men on the board, or in case of equality he who lost the last rendezvous, moves to the border one of his men, unless all be already on it: the other does the same, and so on alternately. The Player named first in this Rule then sets the mark as in Rule 5, and the game proceeds as before till one Player <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-12">has taken four of his adversary’s men, which wins the game.</span></p>
<aside class="toggle variant wide" id="annotation-12"><p>has lost four men.</p>

<p>I shall be very grateful to any of the Knot-untiers or any other readers of the <i>Monthly Packet</i>, who will try this new version of ‘Lanrick’ and make suggestions for its further improvement. I shall also be very glad to have records of sets of games between the same two players, where each begins half the entire set, with results, in the following form:—</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>100 games between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span><i>A</i> began 50, of which <i>A</i> won 32;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span><i>B</i> began 50, of which <i>A</i> won 27.</p>

<p>I beg to thank <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">H. M. S. Pinafore</span> for her suggestion about ‘Mischmasch,’ which deserves, and shall have, careful consideration.</p>
