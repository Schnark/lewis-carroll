<h2>“Life on a Lonely Isle of the Sea.”</h2>
<p>Source: St.&nbsp;James’s Gazette, November 13, 1889</p></header>
<article>

<p class="subtitle">To the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Editor</span> of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">St.&nbsp;James’s Gazette</span></p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir</span>,—In case any of your readers should feel any interest in the paragraph, with the above heading, which appears in your columns this evening, it may be worth while to correct a few inaccuracies in Captain Fearon’s account of the people, and of my brother, the Rev.&nbsp;E. H. Dodgson, who is “priest in charge,” of the island of Tristan d’Acunha.</p>

<p>So far from having to “eke out an existence,” they have plenty of meat and vegetables; and some of them may even be called “wealthy.” The chief drawback is that wheat will not grow there; and, as there are sometimes long intervals without vessels touching there, they are liable to exhaust their supply of flour. My brother has been there for three years, not eight; and, so far from its being “without fee or reward,” he has received, during those three years, two handsome donations from the S.P.G.; from whom also he received, during a previous sojourn at the island, a regular annual stipend.</p>

<p>It is true that the Government send a man-of-war once a year, to report on the condition of the people, but this is anything but “their only communication with the outer world;” many ships touch there in the course of the year.</p>

<p>One sufficient objection to their being removed “to a more favoured region,” is that they would have to go as <i>paupers</i>, as their wealth consists almost entirely of live stock, whose conveyance to any other country would cost more than the value of the stock.—I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
