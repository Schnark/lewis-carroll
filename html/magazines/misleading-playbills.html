<h2>Misleading Playbills</h2>

<p class="subtitle">To the Editor of the Standard</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sir</span>,—Will you kindly allow me space in your columns for a word of warning to the play-going public against putting implicit confidence in the advertisements and playbills of the Strand Theatre?</p>

<p>Last Saturday afternoon I went there with three friends; we had purchased our tickets a week beforehand, and I myself had come up to town for the day from a distance of nearly thirty miles, with the special purpose of seeing Miss St.&nbsp;John play Madame Favart. Her name was advertised as usual in the papers: it occupied its usual place in the bill handed to us in the theatre; but the part was played by a substitute, and that without a word of explanation or apology for the absence of the principal performer. I feel sure that my feeling of disappointment, and of having failed to get that for which I had paid my money, was shared by many of those present.</p>

<p>As tho name of Miss St.&nbsp;John continues to be advertised in the papers, I think a timely warning may save others from being misled, as I was, by an artifice unworthy of a theatre like the Strand.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
