<h2>To Find the Day of the Week for Any Given Date</h2>
<p>Source: Nature, March 31, 1887</p></header>
<article>

<p>Having hit upon the following method of mentally computing the day of the week for any given date, I send it you in the hope that it may interest some of your readers. I am not a rapid computer myself, and as I find my average time for doing any such question is about 20 seconds, I have little doubt that a rapid computer would not need 15.</p>

<p>Take the given date in 4 portions, viz. the number of centuries, the number of years over, the month, the day of the month.</p>

<p>Compute the following 4 items, adding each, when found, to the total of the previous items. When an item or total exceeds 7, divide by 7, and keep the remainder only.</p>

<p><i>The Century-Item.</i>—For Old Style (which ended September 2, 1752) subtract from 18. For New Style (which began September 14) divide by 4, take overplus from 3, multiply remainder by 2.</p>

<p><i>The Year-Item.</i>—Add together the number of dozens, the overplus, and the number of 4’s in the overplus.</p>

<p><i>The Month-Item.</i>—If it begins or ends with a vowel, subtract the number, denoting its place in the year, from 10. This, plus its number of days, gives the item for the following month. The item for January is “0”; for February or March (the 3rd month), “3”; for December (the 12th month), “12.”</p>

<p><i>The Day-Item</i> is the day of the month.</p>

<p>The total, thus reached, must be corrected, by deducting “1” (first adding 7, if the total be “0”), if the date be January or February in a Leap Year: remembering that every year, divisible by 4, is a Leap Year, excepting only the century-years, in New Style, when the number of centuries in <i>not</i> so divisible (<i>e.&thinsp;g.</i> 1800).</p>

<p>The final result gives the day of the week, “0” meaning Sunday, “1” Monday, and so on.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4>1783, <i>September</i> 18</h4>

<p>17, divided by 4, leaves “1” over; 1 from 3 gives “2”; twice 2 is “4.”</p>

<p>83 is 6 dozen and 11, giving 17; plus 2 gives 19, <i>i.&thinsp;e.</i> (diving by 7) “5.” Total 9, <i>i.&thinsp;e.</i> “2.”</p>

<p>The item for August is “8 from 10,” <i>i.&thinsp;e.</i> “2”; so, for September, it is “2 plus 3,” <i>i.&thinsp;e.</i> “5.” Total 7, <i>i.&thinsp;e.</i> “0,” which goes out.</p>

<p>18 gives “4.” Answer, “<i>Thursday.</i>”</p>

<h4>1676, <i>February</i> 23</h4>

<p>16 from 18 gives “2.”</p>

<p>76 is 6 dozen and 4, giving 10; plus 1 gives 11, <i>i.&thinsp;e.</i> “4.” Total “6.”</p>

<p>The item for February is “3.” Total 9, <i>i.&thinsp;e.</i> “2.”</p>

<p>23 gives “2.” Total “4.”</p>

<p>Correction for Leap Year gives “3.” Answer, “<i>Wednesday.</i>”</p>
