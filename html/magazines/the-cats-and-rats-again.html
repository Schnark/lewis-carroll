<h2>The Cats and Rats Again</h2>
<p>Source: The Monthly Packet, February 1880</p>

<p>This is an answer to an earlier “Spider Question”, which Carroll obviously saw and wanted to comment on. This probably led to the “Knots” published in the following years. By the way, a similar comment is made by Sam Loyd in his <i>Cyclopedia of 5000 Puzzles, Tricks and Conundrums with Answers</i> (<a href="https://archive.org/details/CyclopediaOfPuzzlesLoyd/page/n120/mode/1up">https://archive.org/details/CyclopediaOfPuzzlesLoyd/page/n120/mode/1up</a>). Since he obviously knew well the work of Lewis Carroll (including lesser known texts), his comment might be based on this text.</p></header>

<p>‘If 6 cats kill 6 rats in 6 minutes, how many will be needed to kill 100 rats in 50 minutes?’</p>

<p>This is a good example of a phenomenon that often occurs in working problems in double proportion; the answer looks all right at first, but, when we come to test it, we find that, owing to peculiar circumstances in the case, the solution is either impossible or else indefinite, and needing further data. The ‘peculiar circumstance’ here is that fractional cats or rats are excluded from consideration, and in consequence of this the solution is, as we shall see, indefinite.</p>

<p>The solution, by the ordinary rules of Double Proportion, is as follows:—</p>

<p><math display="block"><mrow><mrow><mtable displaystyle="false" rowspacing="0.5ex" columnalign="right center right"><mtr><mtd><mtext>6 rats</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>:</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>100 rats</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>50 min.</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>:</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>6 min.</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo>}</mo></mrow><mo>::</mo><mtext>6 cats</mtext><mo>:</mo><mtext>ans.</mtext></mrow></math></p>

<p><math display="block"><mrow><mo>∴</mo><mtext>ans.</mtext><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>100</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>6</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>6</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>50</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>12</mn></mrow></math></p>

<p>But when we come to trace the history of this sanguinary scene through all its horrid details, we find that at the end of 48 minutes 96 rats are dead, and that there remain 4 live rats and 2 minutes to kill them in: the question is, can this be done?</p>

<p>Now there are at least <i>four</i> different ways in which the original feat, of 6 cats killing 6 rats in 6 minutes, may be achieved. For the sake of clearness let us tabulate them:—</p>

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a</span>. All 6 cats are needed to kill a rat; and this they do in one minute, the other rats standing meekly by, waiting for their turn.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">b</span>. 3 cats are needed to kill a rat, and they do it in 2 minutes.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">c</span>. 2 cats are needed, and do it in 3 minutes.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>. Each cat kills a rat all by itself, and takes 6 minutes to do it.</p>

<p>In cases <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">b</span> it is clear that the 12 cats (who are assumed to come quite fresh from their 48 minutes of slaughter) can finish the affair in the required time; but, in case <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">c</span>, it can only be done by supposing that 2 cats could kill two-thirds of a rat in 2 minutes; and in case <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>, by supposing that a cat could kill one-third of a rat in 2 minutes. Neither supposition is warranted by the data; nor could the fractional rats (even if endowed with equal vitality) be fairly assigned to the different cats. For my part, if I were a cat in case <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>, and did not find my claws in good working order, I should certainly prefer to have my one-third-rat cut off from the tail end.</p>

<p>In cases <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">c</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>, then, it is clear that we must provide extra cat-power. In case <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">c</span> <i>less</i> than 2 extra cats would be of no use. If 2 were supplied, and if they began killing their 4 rats at the beginning of the time, they would finish them in 12 minutes, and have 36 minutes to spare, during which they might weep, like Alexander, because there were not 12 more rats to kill. In case <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>, one extra cat would suffice; it would kill its 4 rats in 24 minutes, and have 24 minutes to spare, during which it could have killed another 4. But in neither case could any use be made of the last 2 minutes, except to half-kill rats—a barbarity we need not take into consideration.</p>

<p>To sum up our results. If the 6 cats kill the 6 rats by method <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a</span> or <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">b</span>, the answer is ‘12;’ if by method <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">c</span>, ‘14;’ if by method <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>, ‘13.’</p>

<p>This, then, is an instance of a solution made ‘indefinite’ by the circumstances of the case. If an instance of the ‘impossible’ be desired, take the following:—‘If a cat can kill a rat in a minute, how many would be needed to kill it in the thousandth part of a second?’ The <i>mathematical</i> answer, of course, is ‘60,000,’ and no doubt less than this would <i>not</i> suffice; but would 60,000 suffice? I doubt it very much. I fancy that at least 50,000 of the cats would never even see the rat, or have any idea of what was going on.</p>

<p>Or take this:—‘If a cat can kill a rat in a minute, how long would it be killing 60,000 rats?’ Ah, how long, indeed! My privat opinion is, that the rats would kill the cat.
