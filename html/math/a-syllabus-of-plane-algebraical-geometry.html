<p class="subtitle">Systematically Arranged, with Formal Definitions, Postulates, and Axioms.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Part I. Containing Points, Right Lines, Rectilinear Figures, Pencils, and Circles.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In teaching the subject of Algebraical Geometry, I have found the advantage of giving formal definitions of such words as “axis,” “ordinate,” and “radius-vector,” as giving the learner a clearer notion of the elements of the subject than he could gather for himself from the ordinary treatises.</p>

<p>In drawing up these definitions I found that several of the geometrical terms borrowed from Euclid could not be used in Algebraical Geometry without some modification of their definitions as given by him, whilst other terms were wanted for which he had given no definition at all; hence I was led to prefix to my Definitions of Algebraical Geometry a modernised version of Euclid’s Definitions. The Propositions also of the subject appeared to me to be wanting in uniformity; for example, the relation between an equation of the first degree and a right line is discussed by one writer in the form “to find the equation to a straight line,” (thus assuming the <i>possibility</i> of such an equation being found;) by another, in the form “we proceed to enquire the geometrical signification of a <i>single</i> equation between the co-ordinates.” To remedy such defects as these I endeavoured to reduce the subject to a uniform series of formal Propositions. Such was the origin of the present Syllabus.</p>

<p>I hope it will not be thought presumptuous in me if I here state in order those defects which appear to me to exist in the modern treatises, and for which I have attempted to furnish a remedy; next, the method I have pursued in doing so; and lastly, the defects which still remain unremedied, and to which those, who are desirous of forwarding towards perfection this beautiful science, would do well to turn their attention.
</p><hr class="bigskip">

<p>The defects which I have attempted to remedy relate to three main points in the subject; I. Definitions, II. Enunciations, and III. Treatment of Subject.</p>

<p>I. Definitions. Many of the technical terms employed by the various writers on the subject are left undefined, or only with such definitions as may be gathered from a page or more of explanatory matter; others are <i>inadequately</i> defined, (as, for instance, the angle employed in Polar Co-ordinates, the definition of which, as given in Mr.&nbsp;Salmon’s Conic Sections, p.&nbsp;9, will not apply to the case of a negative radius-vector); and even when a correct and formal definition is furnished, it is only to be found in the passage where the term first occurs, a method likely to give much unnecessary trouble in referring to it afterwards.</p>

<p>II. Enunciations. These, in the present treatises, are only given along with their deinonstrations, which again are interspersed with much explanatory and illustrative matter, all liable to confuse the student who desires to review the subject, briefly and connectedly, as a whole. Moreover there is a great want of uniformity in the language employed, the data being put first in some, and the quæsita in others; while some propositions have no “general enunciation” at all, but begin at once with the “particular enunciation.”</p>

<p>III. Treatment of Subject. The propositions are in too many cases made to depend on each other, so that if we wish to make out the proof of any particular theorem by itself, it is necessary to refer back to the proposition from which it is deduced, and from that perhaps to another, and so at last to build up the required proof. This method would not be so liable to objection if there were any received text-book on the subject, answering to Euclid in Geometry, and furnishing a recognised series of consecutive propositions which could be appealed to as authority; but, as the case now stands, when one writer may prove A from B, and another B from A, the whole system is illogical and therefore unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Again, an unphilosophical method is employed in arriving at various of the necessary formulæ; it is a method neither analytical nor synthetical, but begins in synthesis, and concludes with a kind of analysis, introduced to prove the lawfulness of the assumption made, but giving no information as to how it was originally arrived at. As an instance, we may take the conversion of the equation <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>B</mi><mi>y</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>, into the form of <math><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">cos</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>.</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">sin</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>ρ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>, where the rule is laid down “divide by <math><msqrt><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>B</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></math>,” and we are afterwards told that we <i>may</i> assume <math><mrow><mfrac><mi>A</mi><msqrt><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>B</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">cos</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow></math>, and <math><mrow><mfrac><mi>B</mi><msqrt><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>B</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">sin</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow></math> “<i>since the sum of the squares of these two quantities</i> <math><mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math>.” Again, the focus of the ellipse is introduced by arbitrarily taking two points on the major axis, at a distance from the centre equal to <math><mrow><mo>±</mo><msqrt><mrow><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>−</mo><msup><mi>b</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></mrow></math>, and discussing their properties; but no reason is given why these, rather than any other points, are so chosen for discussion.</p>

<p>A third deficiency is to be found in the notation adopted, where the symbols and language are not adapted to the expansion, which is necessary to meet the larger requirements of Algebraical Geometry of three dimensions. For instance, in the equations, <math><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>−</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mo>′</mo></msup></mrow><mi>l</mi></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>−</mo><msup><mi>y</mi><mo>′</mo></msup></mrow><mi>m</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>, and <math><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>t</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></math>, when referred to rectangular Cartesian axes, it is usual to define “<var>l</var>” and “<var>m</var>” as “the cosine and sine of the angle which the line makes with the X-axis,”<sup id="footnote-1-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> and “<var>t</var>” as “the tangent of the same angle.” On coming to oblique axes, it is found necessary to modify both definitions; “<var>l</var>” and “<var>m</var>” become “the ratios which the sines of the angles, made by the line with the two axes respectively, bear to the sine of the angle between the axes,” and “<var>t</var>,” “the ratio between these two sines themselves.” On examination it appears that the definitions for rectangular axes are included as a particular case of these, and it may now be thought that we have got definitions sufficiently broad for the whole subject, but on coming to Solid Geometry we have to return to the cosines for rectangular axes, (as otherwise the phrase “the sine of the angle between the axes” would be unmeaning,) while for oblique axes we are forced upon the entirely new theory of projections, unless we choose to adopt the following definition for “<var>l</var>,” “the ratio which the sine of the angle made by the line with the intersection of two planes, (namely, the plane in which the line itself and the X-axis lie, and that in which the Y-axis and Z-axis lie,) bears to the sine of the angle made by the X-axis with the same intersection”! This instance will shew how necessary it is to consider the future requirements of Solid Geometry in dealing with Plane Geometry.
</p><hr class="bigskip">

<p>The method I have pursued in endeavouring to remedy these defects may be most conveniently discussed under the same three headings.</p>

<p>I. As to Definitions. In those borrowed from Euclid I have altered no word of his, except where it was necessary, either to bring the language into uniformity with the other definitions, or to meet the new requirements of Algebraical Geometry. In the rest, I have always taken his as the model, being careful at the same time to provide for the subsequent expansion necessary in Solid Geometry. And these definitions I have placed all together, at the commencement of each Book.</p>

<p>II. As to Enunciations. These I have given by themselves, without their proofs, to afford the student a convenient means of reviewing the subject, and testing his knowledge of it, by taking each enunciation in succession, and considering whether or no his unassisted memory can supply the demonstration. Where any difficulty is found in doing this, he is recommended to add a marginal reference to the place where the demonstration may be found, whether in the text-book which he employs on the subject, or in the Appendix to this Syllabus. I have endeavoured to reduce all these enunciations to one uniform shape, always placing the “data” before the “quæsita” or “demonstranda.” Lastly, I have endeavoured to make all the enunciations “general;” and I trust it will be found that they have thus gained in uniformity what they have, in some instances, lost in brevity and clearness.</p>

<p>III. As to Treatment of Subject. I have endeavoured, for reasons which I have already mentioned, to render each proposition, as far as possible, <i>independent</i> of others; and being thus released from the necessity of stringing them together in a consecutive series, I was able to adopt what seemed the more natural principle of arrangement, of beginning with those which involved the fewest and simplest conditions, and so going on to the more complicated. Whether I was right in attempting the further simplification of separating Problems from Theorems, I am now doubtful; it introduced several difficulties which would not have otherwise arisen; still, the great advantages of clearness and convenience of reference made the experiment a plausible one.</p>

<p>Next, I have introduced every new formula in a method as purely <i>analytical</i> as I found possible. For instance, in arriving at the equation to a right line, I first investigate the method of representing a point (the original purpose for which the system of co-ordinates is introduced); then, on finding that <i>two</i> equations are necessary for this, it naturally follows that we should consider the geometrical signification of <i>one</i> such equation taken by itself. Similarly, the rule already alluded to for reducing the equation <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>B</mi><mi>y</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>, to the form <math><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">cos</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>.</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">sin</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>ρ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>, is found at once by simply applying the test that two equations shall represent the same line. And similarly, the co-ordinates of the “focus” of an ellipse may be easily found by solving the Problem “to find a point whose distance, from any given point on the curve, shall be a simple function of the abscissa of that given point.”</p>

<p>Another innovation will be found in the method of treating what is called by Mr.&nbsp;Salmon “abridged notation.” It appeared to me that the symbols “<var>α</var>” and “<var>β</var>,” employed in that system, are in no other sense abridged forms of “<math><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">cos</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>.</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">sin</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></math> &amp;c., than that in which “<var>x</var>” is an abridged form of “<math><mrow><mi>ρ</mi><mo>.</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">cos</mo><mi>θ</mi></mrow></math>,” (the relation between a Cartesian and a Polar System,) or of “<math><mrow><msup><mi>x</mi><mo>′</mo></msup><mo>.</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">cos</mo><mi>θ</mi><mo>−</mo><msup><mi>y</mi><mo>′</mo></msup><mo>.</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">sin</mo><mi>θ</mi></mrow></math>,” (the relation between two rectangular Cartesian Systems inclined at an angle <var>θ</var>). In other words, it appeared to me simpler, and I have certainly found it to be so in practice, to constitute a new System of reference, which I have called the “Distantial” System, and only to introduce the fact that <math><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>.</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">cos</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>.</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">sin</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></math>, as <i>a formula of transformation from a Distantial to a Cartesian System</i>.</p>

<p>The distinction introduced between an infinitely small quantity and absolute zero needs perhaps a word of apology, as it is not noticed in other treatises, and indeed belongs more properly to the subject of Differential Calculus. Still it is, at worst, superfluous, and those who think it merely fanciful will find that it can easily be omitted, as nothing in the book is made to depend upon it.</p>

<p>Apology is also due for the number of new words I have introduced; I have not done so in any case without an apparent necessity, to avoid the constant repetition of a cumbrous periphrasis. I will here enumerate the new words introduced, with reference to the pages where their definitions may be found. I have endeavoured to make them, as far as possible, suggest their meaning by their derivations:</p>

<p>divisional-angles, and divisional-ratio <span class="after-dotfill"><a href="#syllabus:divisional-angles">18</a></span><br>

co-radical circles <span class="after-dotfill"><a href="#syllabus:co-radical">96</a></span>
</p><hr class="bigskip">

<p>It remains that I should enumerate those defects in the subject, for which I have not been able here to furnish a remedy.</p>

<p>In the first place, there is something unphilosophical in the very groundwork of the science. It professes to prove, from independent sources, many of the propositions of Pure Geometry, while it is so entirely dependent upon that science for its merest elements, that even the equation to a straight line cannot be investigated without assuming Euclid, Book VI, Prop.&nbsp;4. As long as Algebraical Geometry requires the previous proof of so large a range of geometrical propositions, it cannot fairly be employed to prove any theorems which fall within that range.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are terms employed in the science in more senses than one; for the secondary meaning a new word should be introduced. For example, while we have “superficies” to denote a surface of indefinite extent, and “figure&quot; to denote a limited portion of one—while we have “space” to denote indefinite extent of three dimensions, and “solid” to denote a limited portion of space—the word “line” is made to do double duty. Another example may be found in the word “direction,” discussed in the Appendix, p.&nbsp;124.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there are several instances of two or more words being used in precisely the same sense; these require to be desynonymised, or, if that be impossible, all the synonymous terms, but one, should be excluded from use, and reserved for the possible future requisitions of the subject. As instances of this may be mentioned,
</p><div class="continue"><div class="verse">
<p>denote, represent, indicate, express;<br>
contain, involve, require, postulate;<br>
constant, fixed, invariable, determinate;<br>
given, known, determined.
</p></div></div>

<p>Fourthly, some simple rules are required for ascertaining, in any given problem, whether it may best be solved by the Cartesian, Polar, or Distantial System.
</p><hr class="bigskip">

<p>Many defects in the present Syllabus have been discovered and rectified while the sheets were passing through the press; many more, in an attempt so new, and (so to speak) experimental, have no doubt escaped my notice; there is also a great hiatus in the subject of Trigonometry, the whole of which needs to be systematised in the same way. Still I have thought it better to publish it in its present incomplete state, in order that by bringing it under the notice of more mathematicians than would otherwise have seen it, and so getting more suggestions for its improvement than could otherwise have been obtained, means may be afforded, whether to myself or to some other writer, of hereafter reducing the whole subject to a complete and uniform system, which shall occupy, with regard to Algebraical Geometry, the same position which is occupied by that of Euclid with regard to Pure Geometry.</p>

<h3 id="general-definitions-amp-c">General Definitions, &amp;c.</h3>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Plane Algebraical Geometry</span> is the science of applying the symbols and operations of Algebra and Arithmetic to the subject-matter of Plane Geometry. This subject-matter consists of <i>Points</i>, <i>Lines</i>, and <i>Figures</i>; their relations to each other, viz. <i>distances</i>, and <i>angles</i>; and the properties of all these, viz. <i>magnitude</i>, <i>direction</i>, and <i>position</i>.</p>

<p>This science requires as its data, theoretically, only the sciences of Algebra and Arithmetic, with the definitions, postulates, and axioms of Plane Geometry: in its present state it requires, practically, Geometrical proofs of theorems which range through the first six Books of Euclid.</p>

<p>The present syllabus commences with two Algebraical theorems of special use in the subject, which are placed here for convenience of reference: next are given the definitions, postulates, and axioms of Plane Geometry; these are essentially the same as are found prefixed to the first six Books of Euclid, but with some alterations and additional theorems, required by the nature of the subject. After this the subject of Plane Algebraical Geometry commences. Proofs are supplied with some of the propositions, when they are not to be found in the ordinary treatises on the subject, or at least not in the form here given.</p>

<h5>XIII.</h5>
<p>All right angles are equal to one another.</p>

<h5>XIV.</h5>
<p>When <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">two Lines</span> are terminated in the same point, by the words “the angle between them” may be meant <i>either of two</i> angles.

<hr class="bigskip">

<p>N.B. The word “angle” is used by Euclid to denote such declinations only as are less than the sum of two right angles: it is here used, in a more extended sense, to denote any declination whatever.</p>

<p class="fakeheadline">B. Of direction</p>

<h5>I.</h5>

<h5>VI.</h5>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Each of the two angles <i>between</i> two Lines</span> terminated in the same point has <i>either of two</i> opposite directions, since it may be measured from <i>either</i> Line.</p>

<h4>Axioms</h4>

<h5>I.</h5>
<p>If, when + and − are used to denote the addition and subtraction of magnitudes, a symbol of magnitude be affected with the sign −, it has no geometrical meaning when taken by itself, since a magnitude cannot be subtracted from nothing.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>

<p>This system is again divided into three kinds, the <i>Bilinear</i>, the <i>Trilinear</i>, and the <i>Multilinear</i>.</p>

<p class="fakeheadline">Section I. Bilinear System</p>

<h4>Definitions</h4>

<h5>I.</h5>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Lines of reference</span> are two lines of known position, intersecting in a point, which is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the Vertex of reference</span>.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>
<p>One of these is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the <var>α</var>-line</span>, the other, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the <var>β</var>-line</span>. One <i>side</i> of the <var>α</var>-line, and one <i>side</i> of the <var>β</var>-line, are called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">positive</span>; and that <i>portion</i> of each line of reference, which lies <i>on the negative side</i> of the other, is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">its principal portion</span>.</p>

<h5>III.</h5>
<p>Of any other <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Line</span>, passing through the vertex of reference, <i>either</i> portion at pleasure may be called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">principal</span>.</p>

<h5 id="syllabus:referent">IV.</h5>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">The referents of a Point</span> are its distances from the lines of reference.</p>

<h5>V.</h5>
<p>Of these distances that which is measured from the <var>α</var>-line is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the <var>α</var>-referent of the Point</span>; the other, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">its <var>β</var>-referent</span>. They are represented, if unknown, by <var>α</var>, <var>β</var>; if known, by <math><msup><mi>α</mi><mo>′</mo></msup></math>, <math><msup><mi>β</mi><mo>′</mo></msup></math>, or other such symbols. If these symbols are used in the same expression with <var>α</var> or <var>β</var> representing <i>angles</i>, they may be conveniently distinguished thus, <math><mover><mi>α</mi><mo>¯</mo></mover></math>, <math><mover><mi>β</mi><mo>¯</mo></mover></math>.</p>

<h5>VI.</h5>
<p>If <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a Line</span> pass through the vertex of reference, the angles which its principal portion makes with the principal portions of the lines of reference are called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the divisional-angles of the Line</span>.</p>

<h5>VII.</h5>
<p>Of these angles, that which its principal portion makes with the principal portion of the <var>α</var>-line is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the <var>α</var>-divisional-angle of the Line</span>; the other, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">its <var>β</var>-divisional-angle</span>.</p>

<h5>VIII.</h5>
<p>That direction of revolution <i>from</i> either <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">line of reference</span>, in which a line, coinciding with it, would revolve, about the vertex of reference, <i>away from</i> the <i>negative</i> side of its <i>principal</i> portion, is called the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">positive</span> direction of revolution of that line of reference.</p>

<h5>IX.</h5>
<p>If <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a Line</span> pass through the vertex of reference, the ratio which the <var>β</var>-referent of any point on it bears to the <var>α</var>-referent of the same point, (being equal to the ratio which the sine of the <var>β</var>-divisional-angle of the Line bears to the sine of its <var>α</var>-divisional-angle,) is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the divisional-ratio of the Line</span>. If known, it is represented by <var>k</var>, or <var>l</var>, or other such symbol.</p>

<h5>X.</h5>
<p>If <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a Line</span> do <i>not</i> pass through the vertex of reference, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">its divisional-angles</span>, and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">its divisional-ratio</span>, are the same as those of a Line, parallel to it, and passing through the vertex of reference.</p>

<h5>XI.</h5>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">The intercepts of a Line</span> are the <var>α</var>-referent of the point where it intersects the <var>β</var>-line, together with the <var>β</var>-referent of the point where it intersects the <var>α</var>-line. They are called respectively <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the <var>α</var>-intercept</span>, and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the <var>β</var>-intercept</span>, and are represented, if unknown, by <math><msub><mi>α</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math>, <math><msub><mi>β</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math>; if known, by <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, or other such symbols.</p>

<h4>Postulates</h4>

<h5>I.</h5>
<p>Let it be granted that the position of any <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Point</span> may be represented by representing the lengths and directions of its <i>referents</i>. And that, if these be represented, one Point, <i>and one only</i>, is represented.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>
<p>That the position of any <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Line</span> may be represented by representing the positions of <i>two points on it</i>; or the position of <i>one point on it</i>, together with its <i>divisional-ratio</i>. And that, if these be represented, one Line, <i>and one only</i>, is represented.</p>

<p>For remainder of Postulates see Chap.&nbsp;I. Post.&nbsp;3, 4, 5.</p>

<h4>Axioms</h4>

<h5>I.</h5>
<p>That direction of revolution <i>from</i> either <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">line of reference</span>, in which a line, coinciding with it, would revolve, about the vertex of reference, <i>away from</i> the <i>positive</i> side of its <i>principal</i> portion is <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">negative</span>.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>
<p>The divisional-ratio of a Line has the <i>same</i> sign, in <i>whichever</i> portion of the Line the point, from which it is estimated be taken, and <i>whichever</i> of the two portions of the Line be called principal: its sign depends only on the <i>position</i> of the Line.</p>

<h5>III.</h5>
<p>If a Line, passing through the vertex of reference, lie in the angle contained between the principal portions of the lines of reference, its divisional-ratio is positive; if other wise, negative.</p>

<h5>IV.</h5>
<p>When the lines of reference are perpendicular to each other, they may be considered as Cartesian rectangular axes, by taking the <i>lines</i> themselves as <i>axes</i>, the <i>vertex of reference</i> as <i>origin</i>, and the directions in which the <i>principal</i> portions of the lines lie with regard to the vertex as the <i>negative</i> directions of the two axes respectively. In this case the <i>referents</i> of a Point will coincide with its <i>Cartesian co-ordinates</i>, and the <i>divisional-ratio</i> of a Line with its <i>Cartesian co-ordinate-ratio</i>.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>

<h5>VI.</h5>
<p>Conversely, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">any Locus</span> may be represented by <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">one Equation</span>, provided that the condition to be fulfilled by every Point on it is capable of being expressed in terms of the referents of that Point.</p>

<p>N.B. Problems of this nature are discussed in Book VI.</p>

<h5>VII.</h5>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Locus of any simple Equation, containing <var>α</var>, or <var>β</var>, or both</span>, is, (with one exception, mentioned in Corollary 2,) <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a Line</span>.

<h3 id="book-v-discussion-of-points-right-lines-rectilinear-figures-and-pencils">Book V. Discussion of Points, Right Lines, Rectilinear Figures, and Pencils</h3>

<p>This Book contains two Divisions, <i>Problems</i> and <i>Theorems</i>.</p>

<p>The object of each Problem is to represent algebraically some <i>required</i> magnitude, Point, or Line, in terms of the algebraical symbols representing certain <i>given</i> magnitudes, Points, or Lines. The expression, so found, is called a <i>formula</i>. Some of these formulæ are intended to be worked out merely as <i>models</i> for the solution of other Problems of the same kind. Others are intended to be <i>used</i> in solving Problems, proving Theorems, and investigating Loci. This latter class should be committed to memory, for which purpose the formulæ themselves will be given hereafter in a separate list.</p>

<p>The object of each Theorem is to prove some fact concerning certain given magnitudes, Points, or Lines. In proving a theorem we may employ whatever system is most convenient for the purpose; hence the Theorems are not classed according to the three systems. But since, whatever system be employed, formulæ in that system are required, therefore the Problems are again divided into three Chapters, on the <i>Cartesian</i>, <i>Polar</i>, and <i>Distantial</i> Systems.</p>

<p>Each Chapter is divided, according as the Problems involve the consideration of
</p><div class="continue"><div class="verse">
<p>A. Points and Finite Lines.<br>
B. Lines which are the Loci of Simple Equations.<br>
C. Figures.<br>
D. Pencils.

<h4>Definitions</h4>

<h5>I.</h5>
<p>When a Point, situated in the same line with two other Points, lies <i>between</i> them, it is said to divide the line joining them <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">internally</span>; when otherwise, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">externally</span>.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>
<p>When a Point, situated in the same plane with a rectilinear Figure, lies <i>within</i> the Figure, then, if it be joined to the vertices of the Figure, the joining lines are said to divide the Figure <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">internally</span>; when <i>without</i> it, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">externally</span>.</p>

<h5>III.</h5>
<p>When a Line, situated in the same plane, and terminated at the same point, with two other Lines, lies <i>within</i> the angle contained between them, it is said to divide that angle <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">internally</span>; when <i>without</i> it, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">externally</span>.</p>

<h4>Division II. Theorems</h4>

<p>N.B. The following Theorems are given merely as specimens of those which may be proved with the help of the foregoing formulæ.</p>

<p>Algebraical proofs might possibly be made for all the Theorems in the first six Books of Euclid, and it would be excellent practice for the Student to find them for himself. Since, however, the same Theorems must necessarily have been proved <i>Geometrically</i> in order to establish the elementary propositions of this Science in its present state, all such <i>Algebraical</i> proofs involve the Logical fallacy of arguing in a circle: they are therefore, philosophically speaking, valueless, and cannot properly be included in any formal treatise on the subject.</p>

<h3 id="book-vi-investigation-of-loci">Book VI. Investigation of Loci</h3>

<p>The general problem of this Book is, given certain conditions to be fulfilled by a variable Point, to find an Equation to the Locus; and this Equation can always be found, provided that an infinite number of Points exist, fulfilling the given conditions, and that those conditions are capable of being expressed in an Equation involving the co-ordinates, or referents, of the variable Point.</p>

<p>In finding the required Equation, any System may be employed that appears to be most convenient for the purpose. As a general rule, when <i>two</i> fixed Lines are given, the <i>Cartesian</i> or <i>Bilinear</i> Systems may be used; when <i>three</i>, the <i>Trilinear</i>; and when a variable <i>angle</i> is involved in the conditions, the <i>Polar</i> System.</p>

<h3 id="book-vii-the-circle">Book VII. The Circle</h3>

<p>This Book contains three Divisions.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>I. Equations to the Circle.<br>
II. Problems.<br>
III. Theorems.
</p></div>

<p>Each of the two first Divisions contains three Chapters, on the <i>Cartesian</i>, <i>Polar</i>, and <i>Distantial</i> Systems. The third Division, and the separate Chapters of the second Division, are sub-divided as in Book V.</p>

<hr class="bigskip">

<p>The word “Circle” is always employed by Euclid to denote a <i>figure</i>, and the word “circumference” to denote its <i>bounding line</i>: and his definitions of the Points and Lines connected with it are all based upon this notion. These definitions are given in this syllabus among those on “Plane Geometry.”</p>

<p>But in Algebraical Geometry the word “Circle” is employed to denote the <i>bounding line</i> itself, and the word “area” to denote the enclosed <i>figure</i>. This convention is adopted in order to preserve the analogy between this and some other curves, to be hereafter discussed, which do not contain any <i>figure</i> properly so called, and must therefore necessarily be treated as <i>curved lines</i>.</p>

<p>N.B. The words “semicircle” and “segment of a Circle” still retain the meanings given to them by Euclid.</p>

<h4>Definitions</h4>

<h5>I.</h5>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">A Circle</span> is a Locus all the points of which lie in the same plane and at the same distance from a certain fixed Point.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>
<p>And this Point is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the Centre of the Circle</span>.</p>

<h5>III.</h5>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">An Arc of a Circle</span> is any portion of it.</p>

<h5>IV.</h5>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">A Radius of a Circle</span> is a line drawn from the centre, and terminated by the Circle.</p>

<h5>V.</h5>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">A Chord of a Circle</span> is the line joining any two points on it.</p>

<h5>VI.</h5>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">A Diameter of a Circle</span> is the Locus of the centres of any system of parallel Chords.</p>

<p>N.B. We shall hereafter prove that this coincides with Euclid’s definition.</p>

<h5>VII.</h5>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">A Circle</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a Line</span> are said to <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">touch</span> each other, when they meet, but do not cut each other, i.&thinsp;e. when the Circle lies wholly on the <i>same</i> side of the Line.</p>

<h5>VIII.</h5>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Two Circles</span> are said to <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">touch</span> each other, when they meet, but do not cut each other, i.&thinsp;e. when each Circle lies wholly on the <i>same</i> side, (whether it be the <i>outer</i> side, or the <i>inner</i> side,) of the other.</p>

<h5>IX.</h5>
<p>When a Circle and a Line touch each other, the Line is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a Tangent of the Circle</span>.</p>

<h5>X.</h5>
<p>If through the point, where a Line touches a Circle, a Line be drawn perpendicular to the Tangent, it is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a Normal of the Circle</span>.</p>

<h5>XI.</h5>
<p>If from any Point without a Circle 2 Lines be drawn touching the Circle, the line joining the points of contact is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the Chord of contact of the Circle</span> with regard to that Point.</p>

<h5>XII.</h5>
<p>If 2 Circles intersect in 2 points, the line joining the points of intersection is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the Chord of intersection of the 2 Circles</span>.</p>

<h5>XIII.</h5>
<p>When a Line touches 2 Circles, it is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a common Tangent of the 2 Circles</span>.</p>

<h5>XIV.</h5>
<p>When a common Tangent of 2 Circles is such that the 2 Circles lie on the same side of it, it is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">direct</span>; but when such that they lie, one on one side of it, and one on the other, it is called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">transverse</span>.</p>

<h5>XV.</h5>
<p>The Point of intersection of the 2 <i>direct</i> common Tangents of 2 Circles, together with the Point of intersection of their 2 <i>transverse</i> common Tangents, are called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">the Centres of Similitude of the 2 Circles</span>.</p>

<h5>XVI.</h5>
<p>A Circle is said to be <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">inscribed</span> in a rectilinear Figure, when it touches all the sides of that Figure.</p>

<h5>XVII.</h5>
<p>A Circle is said to be <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">circumscribed</span> about a rectilinear Figure, when it passes through all the vertices of that Figure.</p>

<h5>XVIII.</h5>
<p>A Circle is said to be <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">escribed</span> without a rectilinear Figure, when it touches one side of that Figure and the produced portions of the two adjacent sides, produced through the extremities of that side.</p>

<h5>XIX.</h5>
<p>Circles which have the same centre are called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">concentric</span>.</p>

<p>N.B. In future, when a Chord of a Circle is spoken of as if it were an infinite Line, (e.&thinsp;g. when its Equation is said to be given or found,) that Line is intended, of which the Chord forms a part.</p>

<h4>Axioms</h4>

<h5>I.</h5>
<p>If there be given a Circle and a Point, and if through the Point a Line be drawn intersecting the Circle in 2 points: the distances of the 2 points of intersection from the given Point have the <i>same</i> sign, if the given Point lies <i>without</i> the Circle; but <i>opposite</i> signs, if it lies <i>within</i> the Circle.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>
<p>If there be given a Circle and 2 Points, and if the Line passing through them intersect the Circle in 2 points: the ratios, in which the Circle divides, (whether internally or externally,) the line joining the 2 given Points, have the <i>same</i> sign, if the given Points lie, either <i>both within</i>, or <i>both without</i>, the Circle; but <i>opposite</i> signs, if they lie, <i>one within</i> it, and <i>one without</i> it.</p>

<h5>III.</h5>
<p>If there be given a Circle and a Line intersecting it in 2 points, and if the Line be moved so as to make the 2 points of intersection approach each other: the nearer they approach, the less of the Circle will there be on <i>one</i> side of the Line, and the more of it on <i>the other</i> side of the Line, and finally, when they <i>coalesce</i>, the Circle will lie wholly on the <i>same</i> side of the Line, i.&thinsp;e. the Line will become a <i>Tangent</i> of the Circle.</p>

<p>Conversely, if there be given a Circle and a Line touching it: the Line may be moved so as to begin to intersect the Circle in 2 points, which, having at first coalesced in the point of contact, will then begin to recede from each other.</p>

<h5>IV.</h5>
<p>If there be given a Circle and a Point on it, and if through the Point a Line be drawn intersecting the Circle in another point, and if the Line be moved, (either by moving the Point through which it is drawn, or by changing its direction, or both,) so as to make the distance of the second point of intersection from the given Point become less and less: the less it becomes, the nearer will the 2 points of intersection approach each other, and finally, when it <i>becomes</i> <math><mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>, they will <i>coalesce</i>, i.&thinsp;e. the Line will become a <i>Tangent</i> of the Circle.</p>

<p>Conversely, if there be given a Circle and a Point on it, and if through the Point a Line be drawn touching the Circle: the Line may be moved, (either by moving the Point through which it is drawn, or by changing its direction, or both,) so as to begin to intersect the Circle in another point, the distance of which from the given Point, having at first been <math><mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>, will then begin to increase.</p>

<h5>V.</h5>
<p>If there be given a Circle and a Point without it, and if through the Point a Line be drawn intersecting the Circle in 2 points, and if the Line be moved, (either by moving the Point through which it is drawn, or by changing its direction, or both,) so as to make the distances of the 2 points of intersection from the given Point become more and more equal: the more equal they become the nearer will the 2 points of, intersection approach each other, and finally, when they <i>become equal</i>, (i.&thinsp;e. <i>coincide</i>, since they have the <i>same</i> sign,) these 2 points will <i>coalesce</i>, i.&thinsp;e. the Line will become a <i>Tangent</i> of the Circle.</p>

<p>Conversely, if there be given a Circle and a Point without it, and if through the Point a Line be drawn touching the Circle: the Line may be moved, (either by moving the Point through which it is drawn, or by changing its direction, or both,) so as to begin to intersect the Circle in 2 points, the distances of which from the given Point having at first coincided, will then begin to become more and more unequal.</p>

<h5>VI.</h5>
<p>If there be given a Circle and 2 Points without it, and if the Line passing through them intersect the Circle in 2 points, and if the Line be moved, (by moving either or both of the Points through which it is drawn, so as to make the ratios, in which the Circle divides, (whether internally or externally,) the line joining the 2 given Points, become more and more equal: the more equal they become, the nearer will the 2 points of intersection approach each other, and finally, when they <i>become equal</i>, (i.&thinsp;e. <i>coincide</i>, since they have the <i>same</i> sign,) these 2 points will <i>coalesce</i>, i.&thinsp;e. the Line will become a <i>Tangent</i> of the Circle.</p>

<p>Conversely, if there be given a Circle and 2 Points without it, and if the Line passing through them touch the Circle: the Line may be moved, (by moving either or both of the Points through which it is drawn,) so as to begin to intersect the Circle in 2 points, i.&thinsp;e. so that the Circle shall begin to divide the line joining the 2 given Points in 2 ratios, which, having at first coincided, will then begin to become more and more unequal.</p>

<h5>VII.</h5>
<p>If there be given a Circle, a Point, and the abscissa-ratio and ordinate-ratio, (or else the co-ordinate-ratio of a Line passing through the Point, and if the distances of the points, where the Line intersects the Circle, from the given Point, be found: then,

</p></div></div>

<h5>VIII.</h5>
<p>If there be given a Circle and 2 Points, and if the ratios, in which the Circle divides, (whether internally or externally,) the line joining the 2 given Points, be found: then

<p>The Equations to a Circle in this System are, (generally speaking,) too complicated to be worth being discussed separately. Any Questions involving them may be solved by employing the Cartesian System and the Formulæ of transformation of co-ordinates. But, unless the circumstances of the Question lead to some simplification of the Equation, it is better to employ some other System of reference.</p>

<p>It has been already stated that the Equations to a Circle in this System are, generally speaking, too complicated to be worth being discussed separately. And even when the circumstances of the case lead to some simplification of the result, it is generally better to arrive at it by means of the Cartesian System and the Formulæ of transformation of co-ordinates: some problems of this kind are here given.</p>
