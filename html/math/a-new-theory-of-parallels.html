<h3 id="preface-to-third-edition">Preface to Third Edition</h3>
<p>The chief novelty, in the First Edition of this treatise, was the Axiom, by means of which I proved Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32 without making use of his 12th Axiom. And the chief novelty, in this Third Edition, is the change I have made in that Axiom, by substituting ‘Tetragon’ for ‘Hexagon’. The new Figure is more simple, and more easily constructed, than its predecessor: while the Axiom is, I hope, as obviously true as ever.</p>

<p>The proof of my “New Theory of Parallels” is, I think, greatly simplified and improved in this new Edition—the Propositions, which do <i>not</i> require any disputable Axiom, being placed by themselves in ‘Book I,’ while those, which require the new Axiom for their proof, are placed in ‘Book II.’ At the end of Book II will be found a proof (so far as <i>finite</i> magnitudes are concerned) for Euclid’s celebrated 12th Axiom, preceded by, and dependent on, the Axiom tacitly assumed by him in his Book X, Prop.&nbsp;1, and also assumed, I believe, by every subsequent writer who has attempted to <i>prove</i> his 12th Axiom. My proof is borrowed, with some slight alterations, from Cuthbertson’s ‘Euclidean Geometry.’</p>

<p>One advantage, in thus separating the Propositions into two classes, is that it calls attention to the very remarkable and interesting fact that the Theorem “There is a Triangle whose angles are together not-greater than two right angles” is actually provable without any disputable Axiom whatever. If only it could be proved, with equal ease, that “there is a Triangle whose angles are together not-<i>less</i> than two right angles”! But alas, <i>that</i> is an <i>ignis fatuus</i> that has never yet been caught! The man, who first proves <i>that</i> Theorem, without using Euclid’s 12th Axiom or any substitute for it, will certainly deserve a place among the world’s great discoverers.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of replying to one or two criticisms, which have been published, on the Second Edition—earnestly assuring the writers of those criticisms that, in treating the questions at issue between us from a not-wholly-solemn point of view, I have been actuated by no feeling of disrespect towards them, but simply from the wish to lighten a subject, naturally somewhat too heavy and sombre, and thus to make it a little more palatable to the general Reader.
</p><hr class="medskip">

<p>At p.&nbsp;12 of the 2nd Edition, the enunciation of Prop.&nbsp;VI (which re-appears, in a modified form, at <a href="#new-theory-parallels:prop-b">p.&nbsp;34</a> of the 3rd Edition) stood thus:—</p>

<p>“<i>If the vertical angle of a Sector of a Circle be divided by radii into <math><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>n</mi></msup></math> equal angles, thus forming <math><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>n</mi></msup></math> equal Sectors; and if the chord of each such Sector be not less than the radius of the Circle: the original Sector is not less than <math><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>n</mi></msup></math> times the Triangle cut off from it hy its chord.</i>” My controversy with <i>Nature</i>, on this enunciation, will be best given in the form of a dialogue. (Of course I quote <i>verbatim</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Nature</i>. (Dec.&nbsp;6, 1888.) “How are the figures to be constructed, if <var>n</var> be greater than 2?”</p>

<p><i>Author</i>. (In the Preface to the 2nd Edition, at p.&nbsp;x.) “Well, suppose <var>n</var> were equal to 4: i.&thinsp;e. we have to divide the vertical angle into <math><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>n</mi></msup></math> equal parts. Bisect it: that gives halves. Bisect the halves: that gives quarters. Bisect again: that gives eighths. Bisect once more: that give sixteenths. <i>Voila tout!</i>”</p>

<p><i>Nature</i>. (June&nbsp;13, 1889.) “Shade of Euclid! Who knows not such things? We admitted the same, but stated that our difficulty in the construction was the condition imposed in the enunciation: viz., ‘the chord of each such sector not less than the radius of the circle.’ Take Mr.&nbsp;Dodgson’s illustration of a sixteenth: this would necessitate that the original angle should be at least 960°. … we … have further noted that no one of the chords in Mr.&nbsp;Dodgson’s figures is even equal to the radius.”</p>

<p><i>Author</i>. “What you call ‘the condition imposed’ is introduced with an ‘if’: it is merely an <i>hypothesis:</i> all I undertake to prove is that, <i>if</i> certain things were true, certain other things <i>would</i> be true. Surely I need not remind you that the <i>validity</i> of a Syllogism is quite independent of the <i>truth</i> of its Premisses! <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-1">‘I have sent for you, my dear Ducks’, said the worthy Mrs.&nbsp;Bond, ‘to enquire with what sauce you would like to be eaten?’ ‘But we don’t want to be <i>killed!</i>’ cried the Ducks. ‘<i>You are wandering from the point</i>’ was Mrs.&nbsp;Bond’s perfectly logical reply.</span> So here. ‘I beg you to observe, my dear <i>Nature</i>, that, <i>if</i> the chord of each Sector were not less than the radius, the logical result would be so-and-so.’ ‘But the chord is less than the radius!’ you cry. All I need say, in reply, is ‘<i>You are wandering from the point</i>.’”</p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-1"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>David Copperfield</i> by Charles Dickens</aside>

<p>“But I will be generous, and will say more. I take exception to <i>two</i> assertions of yours. Remember our logical stand-point. We may use Euclid’s Axioms, all but the last; and his Propositions as far as I.&nbsp;28. Now be good enough to prove to me, with this machinery, first, that my hypothesis ‘necessitates that the original angle should be at least 960°’; secondly, that ‘no one of the chords’ in my Figure ‘is even equal to the radius.’ Your logical position is, I fear, this. You dispute the <i>validity</i> of a certain argument, on the ground that its <i>premisses</i> are false. My reply is, first, that you cannot <i>prove</i> them false; and secondly, that, even if you <i>could</i>, it wouldn’t affect the question!”
</p><hr class="medskip">

<p>At p.&nbsp;19 of the 2nd Edition, the new Axiom, on which my Theory rests, (which re-appears, in a modified form, at <a href="#new-theory-parallels:axiom-1">p.&nbsp;14</a> of the 3rd Edition), stood thus:—“In every Circle, the inscribed equilateral Hexagon is greater than any one of the Segments which lie outside it.” My controversy with the <i>Athenæum</i>, on this Axiom, shall also be given in the form of a dialogue.</p>

<p><i>Athenæum</i>. (Oct.&nbsp;27, 1888.) “… a stronger objection, in our opinion, is the implied assumption of the <i>possibility</i> of the inscribed equilateral Hexagon, a possibility which is not demonstrated till we reach the fifteenth Proposition of Euclid’s fourth book.</p>

<p><i>Author</i>. (In the Preface to the 2nd Edition, at p.&nbsp;xi). “But does it <i>need</i> demonstrating? May we not <i>assume</i> (1) that the Magnitude ‘four right angles’ contains 6-6ths of itself; (2) that it is <i>theoretically</i> possible to draw radii dividing it into these 6-6ths? Once grant me this, and I ask no more. I have then the logical <i>right</i> to join the ends of these radii, and to prove (by Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;4) that the chords are equal.”</p>

<p><i>Athenæum</i>. (Oct.&nbsp;5, 1889.) “We objected that it was not consistent with the spirit or practice of Euclid’s reasoning to assume the ‘theoretical possibility’ of a regular Hexagon inscribed in a Circle, without first proving that such a figure could be actually constructed from his three postulates. Euclid’s restrictions may be arbitrary, unnecessary, cramping, vexatious, absurd—indeed, we think they deserve these and many other epithets—but there they are, and, if Mr.&nbsp;Dodgson accepts them, he is bound to keep his assumptions within the boundaries which they prescribe.”</p>

<p><i>Author</i>. “<span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-2">You’re particular to a shade</span> (as Scrooge said to Marley’s ghost): however, I’ll do what I can to oblige you. I presume you will be satisfied if I can, without using more of Euclid than his first 28 Propositions, construct an angle which shall be 1-6th of 4 right angles? Very good. First, then, with the help of his arbitrary Prop.&nbsp;I, I construct an equilateral Triangle. Next, by his unnecessary Prop.&nbsp;IX, I draw the bisectors of 2 of its angles. Next, by his cramping Post.&nbsp;1, I join their point of intersection to the third vertex. Next, by his vexatious Prop.&nbsp;IV, I prove the 3 angles, whose common vertex is this point, to be equal. From which I draw the absurd conclusion that each of them is 1-3rd (and that therefore its half is 1-6th) of 4 right angles. How does that strike <i>you?</i>”
</p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-2"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>A Christmas Carol</i> by Charles Dickens</aside><hr class="medskip">

<p>Another objection, to this same Axiom, appeared in the <i>Academy</i> for Feb.&nbsp;9, 1889, viz. “What the Axiom practically assumes is the existence of similar figures.” Permit me to reply, to this Reviewer, as follows:—“In what sense do you use the word ‘similar’? In <i>Euclid’s</i>, no doubt. That is to say, you charge me with assuming that, if the Circle and its inscribed Hexagon were supposed to expand, the magnitude of each angle and the ratio subsisting between tho sides which contain it, would remain constant? The ‘ratio’ part of the question we may set aside at once: there is no doubt that, since the figure continues to be equilateral, the ratio continues to be a ratio of <i>unity</i>: hence, if I needed this assumption (which I don’t), I should have a perfect right to make it. All, that remains for discussion, is the assumption, which you say I have made, that each <i>angle</i> of the expanding Hexagon remains constant in magnitude. Will you, then, be kind enough to point out, first, where the <i>need</i> for any such assumption arises; secondly, where I have <i>made</i> any such assumption? For myself, I cannot in the least see why, in estimating the <i>area</i> of the Hexagon, I should trouble myself about the size of its <i>angles</i>.”</p>

<p>Let me take this opportunity of pointing out, once more, that <i>not one Proposition in this Treatise depends, in the slightest degree, on the speculations about Infinities, &amp;c., which occur in the Appendices</i>.</p>

<p>The one merit, the one novelty, of my Theory (if it <i>has</i> any merit, or any novelty) is that, while <i>every</i> other Theory (that I have seen), which attempts to supersede Euclid’s 12th Axiom, introduces the ideas of Infinities and Infinitesimals, <i>mine</i> dispenses <i>wholly</i> with their aid, and deals with nothing but what is, by universal consent, absolutely <i>within</i> the field of Human Reason.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>It may well be doubted whether, in all the range of Science, there is any field so fascinating to the explorer—so rich in hidden treasures—so fruitful in delightful surprises—as that of Pure Mathematics. The charm lies chiefly, I think, in the absolute <i>certainty</i> of its results: for that is what, beyond almost all mental treasures, the human intellect craves for. Let us only be sure of <i>something</i>! More light, more light! <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-3"><span lang="grc">Ἐν δέ φάει καί ὀλέσσον.</span> ‘And, if our lot be death, give light and let us die!’</span> This is the cry that, through all the ages, is going up from perplexed Humanity, and Science has little else to offer, that will really meet the demands of its votaries, than the conclusions of Pure Mathematics. Most other Sciences are in a state of constant flux—the precious truths of one generation being smiled at as paradoxes by the second generation, and contemptuously swept away as childish nonsense by the third. If you would see a specimen of the rapidity of this process of decomposition, take Biology for a sample: quote, to any distinguished Biologist you happen to meet, some book published thirty years ago, and observe his pitying smile!</p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-3"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>Iliad</i> by Homer</aside>

<p>But neither thirty years, nor thirty centuries, affect the clearness, or the charm, of Geometrical truths. Such a theorem as ‘the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the sides’ is as dazzlingly beautiful now as it was in the day when Pythagoras first discovered it, and celebrated its advent, it is said, by sacrificing a hecatomb of oxen—a method of doing honour to Science that has always seemed to me <i>slightly</i> exaggerated and uncalled-for. One can imagine oneself, even in these degenerate days, marking the epoch of some brilliant scientific discovery by inviting a convivial friend or two, to join one in a beefsteak and a bottle of wine. But a <i>hecatomb</i> of oxen! It would produce a quite inconvenient supply of beef.</p>

<p>Now this field of Mathematical research, with all its wealth of hidden treasure, is all too apt to yield nothing to our research: for it is haunted by certain <i>ignes fatui</i>—delusive phantoms, that float before us, and seem so fair, and are <i>all but</i> in our grasp, so nearly that it never seems to need more than <i>one</i> step further, and the prize shall be ours! Alas for him who has been turned aside from real research by one of these spectres—who has found a music in its mocking laughter—and who wastes his life and energy in the desperate chase!</p>

<p>One of these—the chief one, I think—is the old old problem of ‘Squaring the Circle,’ which has certainly wasted many a human life. Whether it has actually driven any one mad, I know not—most of its victims were, I fancy, partly crazed before they entered on the quest—but it clearly has the powder of demolishing such slender reasoning powers as they may ever have chanced to possess.</p>

<p>With two of these misguided visionaries I have myself corresponded.</p>

<p>The first who addressed me filled me with a great ambition—to do a feat I had never yet heard of as accomplished by man, namely, to convince a ‘Circle-Squarer’ of his error! The value my friend had selected for ‘<var>π</var>’ was <i>not</i> an original one—being 3·2: but the enormous error, beginning as early as the <i>first</i> decimal place, tempted one with the idea that it could be easily demonstrated to <i>be</i> an error. I should think more than a score of letters were interchanged before I became sadly convinced that I had no chance. What man could still hope on, after receiving such a rebuff as the following? “You persuade yourself,” so my friend wrote, “that you have made your circumscribed polygon equal to the circle, <i>which you know cannot be</i>, and have thereby pushed the quadrant beyond 90°, valuing the circumference at 360°.” I meekly begged to be referred to the actual words in which I had advanced this startling assertion: but I never succeeded in getting the quotation verified.</p>

<p>My second ‘Circle-Squarer’ went to work in quite another fashion. His object was not so much to obtain an <i>arithmetical</i> value for ‘<var>π</var>,’ as to construct a geometrical straight Line which, given the radius, should exhibit to the eye the actual length of the circumference. His diagram was a most imposing one—Triangles and Parallels were interlaced in bewildering profusion—and it used up no less than 23 letters of the alphabet. Some of the Lines had arithmetical values assigned to them: and there was one value, ‘1·8879020478639098461 &amp;c.’, which for a long time baffled all my endeavours to guess how in the world he had invented it. Of course one <i>might</i> have taken exception to such a construction at the very outset, and have said “I will admit the possibility of constructing a Line, which shall bear to the unit-line any arithmetical ratio you like, so long as you express it as an <i>exact</i> decimal: but what <i>can</i> I do with your ‘&amp;c.’?” But his was not the kind of mind to which the geometrical construction of an ‘&amp;c.’ presents any difficulty. At length, after many failures, I chanced on the discovery that this portentous number was <math><mfrac><mn>40</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math> of the decimal part of ‘<var>π</var>’! After this it was no wonder, considering that, in the course of construction, he had taken <math><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math> of this Line, and afterwards divided by 10, that the resulting Line, added to 3 times the unit-Line, was triumphantly proved to represent ‘<var>π</var>’! I ventured to ask if this was the way he had obtained the long decimal quoted above, namely, by multiplying the decimal part of ‘<var>π</var>’ by <math><mfrac><mn>40</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math>, and received the courteous reply “your suggestion is perfectly correct”!</p>

<p>Another <i>ignis fatuus</i>—though not numbering so many victims as the ‘Quadrature of the Circle’—is ‘the Trisection of an Angle’ (that is, its trisection by Euclid’s machinery).</p>

<p>And yet another <i>ignis fatuus</i>—the one with which the following treatise is concerned—is the attempt to dispense with Euclid’s celebrated 12th Axiom.</p>

<p>I may as well state briefly what the feat actually is, which Mathematicians have been vainly trying, since Euclid’s day, to perform.</p>

<p>In I.&nbsp;27, 28, he proves (so far, without invoking the aid of any doubtful Axiom) that “two Lines, which are equally inclined to a certain transversal (whether by making a pair of alternate angles equal, or an exterior equal to its interior opposite angle, or two interior, on the same side of the transversal, together equal to two right angles), will never meet.”</p>

<p>Next, in logical order, comes his 12th Axiom, viz. that “two Lines, which are unequally inclined to a certain transversal (he only <i>names</i> the case where they make two interior angles together less than two right angles, but he might fairly have included the others), <i>will</i> meet.” This Axiom, as I hope to prove in Appendix&nbsp;III, is only <i>partially</i>, and not <i>universally</i>, true.</p>

<p>Next, in I.&nbsp;29, he proves (with the aid of this Axiom, of which it is what De Morgan calls the ‘contranominal’) the partially-true Theorem that “two Lines, which never meet, are equally inclined to any transversal.”</p>

<p>And from this, in I.&nbsp;32, he proves that “the three angles of a Triangle are together equal to two right angles.”</p>

<p>These are only specimens of a set of Theorems which can be proved when once Axiom 12 is granted (e.&thinsp;g. there are several about ‘equidistantial Lines,’ which Euclid has altogether ignored): but they are all so connected as to follow easily from these.</p>

<p>Now the great difficulty, which besets this subject, is that Euclid’s Axiom (this, I think, is universally admitted) id <i>not</i> axiomatic—the intellect has not yet occurred, among that species of Vertebrates which may be defined as ‘bimanous bipeds,’ which accepts it as a genuine Axiom—and the great question to be answered is “can a better Axiom be found?”</p>

<p>In Appendix&nbsp;IV, I will mention some of the substitutes that have been suggested, and will give some account of the ‘outlook’ in the direction of the new Axiom I have chanced on. In this place it will suffice, first, to explain what the task is that the long-desiderated Axiom has to perform, and secondly, to state the grounds on which I claim acceptance for my Axiom.</p>

<p>First, then, what is ‘the coming Axiom’ expected to do for us?</p>

<p>It will be convenient to divide the whole class, of Theorems needing proof, into two sub-classes—one including those which are <i>universally</i> true: the other those which are only <i>partially</i> true—the error, if any, being <i>infinitesimal</i> when compared with the Magnitudes with which the Theorem is concerned.</p>

<p>Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32 is a specimen of the one kind, and Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;29 of the other.</p>

<p>In proving the <i>latter</i> class, no substitute for Euclid’s Axiom has yet been suggested, that I know of, which does not suffer from the same defect as Euclid’s Axiom—the being only <i>partially</i>, and not <i>universally</i>, true—and which does not, if we attempt to modify the language so as to remedy this defect, in <i>some</i> way lead us into the bewildering region of Infinities and Infinitesimals.</p>

<p>But the <i>former</i> class can, as I believe, be more easily proved. This is what I attempt in the following treatise—which owes its inspiration to a sudden thought (it occurred to me some two months ago) that it <i>might</i> be possible to prove Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32 without getting mixed up with those spectral Infinities.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is quite possible to bring into this class all that is valuable in Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;29. Regarding the ‘separateness’ of the Lines merely as a link between Props.&nbsp;27, 28, and 29, we may combine the three into one grand Theorem, thus:—“Two Lines, which are equally inclined to a certain transversal, are so to every transversal.” This Theorem, as well as Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32, I prove in the following treatise. But the feat of proving them, without assuming any new Axiom <i>at all</i>, is at present beyond my grasp. Like the goblin ‘Puck,’ it has led me <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-4">“up and down, up and down,”</span> through many a wakeful night: but always, just as I thought I had it, some unforeseen fallacy was sure to trip me up, and the tricksy sprite would <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-5">“leap out, laughing ho, ho, ho!”</span></p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-4"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> by William Shakespeare</aside>

<img src="../../images/cm-i/02.svg" width="58" height="58" alt="A circle with inscribed square.">
</figure>

<p>And now, to come to the real gist of this over-long Preface—however, nobody ever reads a Preface, so really it does not matter—am I not right in thinking that, on mere inspection of this diagram, any sane intellect will be ready to grant that “in any Circle, the inscribed Tetragon is greater than any one of the Segments that lie outside it”?</p>

<p>I shall be told, no doubt, that this is too <i>bizarre</i> and unprecedented an Axiom—that it is an appeal to the <i>eye</i>, and not to the reason. That it is somewhat <i>bizarre</i> I am willing to admit—and am by no means sure that this is not rather a <i>merit</i> than a defect. But, as to its being an appeal to the <i>eye</i>, what is “two straight Lines cannot enclose a space” but an appeal to the eye? What is “all right angles are equal” but an appeal to the <i>eye</i>?</p>

<p>In all Axioms, where an appeal is made to the eye on a question of <i>magnitude</i>, we shall find, I think, that the whole region of certainty and probability may be roughly mapped out into three districts—an out-lying district of certainty in <i>one</i> direction, a similar one of certainty in the <i>opposite</i> direction, and a middle district of probability—the boundaries being shadowy and liable to be shifted hither and thither according to the fancies or prejudices of each individual mind.</p>

<p>Permit me to illustrate this by an example taken from ordinary life.</p>

<p>You enter a room, where there is a book-case containing (say) five shelves, and your eye wanders carelessly along a shelf, making a rough estimate of the number of books in it. Now shut your eyes, and try to guess how many books there are altogether. Your hasty reckoning of one shelf gave a total (say) of 19 or 20, you are not sure which: so you feel safe in saying “I think there are <i>about</i> a hundred.” “Are you <i>certain</i>,” I ask, “that there are more than fifty?” “<i>Quite</i> certain,” you reply. “And also certain that there are less than a hundred and fifty?” “<i>Quite</i> certain,” you repeat. Here, then, are the three districts. The numbers up to 50 are <i>certainly</i> too small; the numbers over 150 are <i>certainly</i> too great; the intermediate numbers contain some doubtful ones—the most doubtful being very near 100—and this doubt shades off into certainty as we approach either of the outlying districts. You would not risk five shillings on the chance of the true number being <i>under</i> 100, or on the chance of its being <i>over</i> 100, but you would feel quite at your ease, if told that you would forfeit a thousand pounds, in case the number turned out to be under 50, or over 150.</p>

<p>Another objection, that has already been raised to my Axiom, and so will probably be raised again, and which I may as well meet here by anticipation, is that, on the supposition of Euclid I.&nbsp;32 <i>not</i> being true, it may be proved that this relationship of magnitude, between the Tetragon and the Segment, changes as the Circle increases, until, with an infinitely great Circle, the Tetragon may actually be proved to be <i>less</i> than the Segment! This phenomenon, however, does not appal me so much as might be expected: for I have often observed it to occur that, when Theorem <i>α</i>logically leads to Theorem <i>β</i>, then, on the supposition of Theorem <i>β</i> <i>not</i> being true, it may be proved that Theorem <i>α</i> also is not true. (The second sequence is, in fact, what De Morgan calls the ‘contranominal’ of the first.) Hence this objection, if worth anything, <i>proves too much</i>: to dispute the validity of an argument, on the ground that, if it were valid, its contranominal would also be valid, is to upset the whole edifice of Logic itself: and, if you tell me, on such grounds as these, that I cannot prove what I assert, I may fairly retort upon you, that <i>you</i> cannot prove anything <i>at all</i>! You have destroyed the only machinery available for the purpose, and must henceforth dispense with all Logical methods, and console yourself with the cynical American adage “There’s nothing true: and there’s nothing new: and it don’t signify!”</p>

<p>To return to our Tetragon. It really contains the area of the Segment a little over 7 times. Hence anybody, I should suppose, would be ready to say “I am <i>certain</i> it contains the Segment more than twice: and I am equally certain it does <i>not</i> contain it twelve times.” In guessing the <i>actual</i> number, observers would greatly differ: some might guess 4, others 10: but <i>all</i> would agree in putting it above 2. And now see how modest is the demand of my Axiom! Merely that you will find room in the Tetragon for one single Segment! If <i>that</i> is not a matter of certainty, is <i>anything</i> certain in this world of ours?</p>

<p>I have yet one more arrow in my quiver: let me shoot it, and have done. If the gentle reader feels any the smallest demur to granting me that <i>once</i> this Tetragon is greater than the Segment lying below it, will he grant me that <i>twice</i> it will suffice? Or four times it? Or eight times it? He may go on doubling as long as he likes, and, so long as he keeps among finite numbers, he will have granted me all I need for a logical proof (which will be found in Appendix&nbsp;I) of Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32. Surely he will not need to go into the Infinities? And may I add, in conclusion, that, if any gentle reader be found, who cannot <i>quite</i> bring himself to believe it impossible to squeeze 512 of these Tetragons into the Segment, but is willing to allow that no amount of skilful packing will dispose of 1024 of them—it will give me <i>real</i> satisfaction to be supplied with that gentle reader’s name and address?</p>

<p class="subtitle">Certain universally-true Propositions, provable from genuine Axioms.</p>

<p class="fakeheadline">Definitions</p>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p>The sum of the angles of a Triangle is called its ‘<b>amount</b>.’</p>

<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Any angular magnitude is called a ‘<b>possible amount</b>,’ if there be a Triangle whose ‘amount’ is equal to it: but, if there be no such Triangle, it is called an ‘<b>impossible amount</b>.’</p>

<h4>3.</h4>

<p>If any such angular magnitude vary continuously: whenever it changes from a ‘possible amount’ to an ‘impossible amount,’ it is said to pass from a ‘<b>possible region</b>,’ to an ‘<b>impossible region</b>’: and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<h4>4.</h4>

<p>If there be two fixed angular magnitudes such that the varying magnitude, while it continues between them, is always a ‘possible amount,’ but becomes an ‘impossible amount’ when it passes beyond them: they are called the ‘<b>superior limit</b>,’ and the ‘<b>inferior limit</b>,’ of the ‘possible region’ which lies between them.</p>

<p class="fakeheadline">Axioms</p>

<h4 id="new-theory-parallels:a1">1.</h4>

<p>If a Magnitude change from one value to another; and if, in doing so, it vary continuously; and if a certain value, intermediate to its first and last values, be selected: the Magnitude must, at some moment during the process of change, have that selected value.</p>

<h4>2.</h4>

<p>If two or more Magnitudes be such that, whenever any one of them varies, it varies continuously: then, whenever their sum varies, it varies continuously.</p>

<h4>Prop.&nbsp;I. Theorem.</h4>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">If a Pair of Lines make, with a certain transversal, either (1) a pair of alternate angles equal, or (2) an exterior angle equal to its interior opposite angle on the same side of the transversal, or (3) a pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal supplementary: they will make, with that transversal, (4), each pair of alternate angles equals and (5) each of the four exterior angles equal to its interior opposite angle on the same side of the transversal, and (6) each pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal supplementary.</span></p>

<p>This Proposition is easily deduced from Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;13, 15.</p>

<p>Such a Pair of Lines may be said to be ‘<b>equally inclined</b>’ to that transversal.</p>

<h4>Prop.&nbsp;IV. Theorem.</h4>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Either all Triangles have the same ‘amount’; or else, if <var>α</var>, <var>β</var>, he two ‘possible amounts,’ that is, ‘amounts’ belonging to existing Triangles, then any ‘amount’ intermediate to <var>α</var> and <var>β</var>, in also ‘possible.’</span></p>

<figure style="max-width:25em;">
<img src="../../images/cm-i/07.svg" width="117" height="77" alt="A mathematical diagram as described in the text.">
</figure>

<p>If all Triangles have the same amount, the Proposition is true. If not, let <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>B</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></math>, <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>D</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow></math> be two Triangles whose amounts are different. Call their ‘amounts’ ‘<var>α</var>, <var>β</var>.’ And let the two Triangles be placed so as to have a common vertex at <var>A</var>, and their bases in the same straight Line.</p>

<p>Now Triangle <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>B</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></math> may be converted into Triangle <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>B</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></math> by making the point, where <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></math> intersects <math><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></math>, move from <var>C</var> to <var>F</var>, <math><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></math> remaining stationary.</p>

<p>And, during this process, the angle at <var>A</var> will vary continuously, <span class="after-hfill">[Ax.&nbsp;4.</span></p>

<p>and the angle, at the point where the revolving Line intersects <math><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></math>, will vary continuously; <span class="after-hfill">[Ax.&nbsp;5.</span></p>

<p>∴ the sum of these angles will, if it vary at all, vary continuously. <span class="after-hfill">[Ax.&nbsp;3.</span></p>

<p>Similarly, Triangle <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>B</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></math> may be converted, first, into Triangle <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>B</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow></math>, by making the point, where <math><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></math> intersects <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow></math>, move from <var>F</var> to <var>E</var>, <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow></math> remaining stationary, and then into Triangle <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>D</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow></math>, by making the point, where <math><mrow><mi>E</mi><mi>B</mi></mrow></math> intersects <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>, move from <var>B</var> to <var>D</var>, <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math> remaining stationary.</p>

<p>And, during the whole process, the ‘amount’ of the changing Triangle will, if it vary at all, vary continuously.</p>

<p>Hence, in changing from the value <var>α</var> to the value <var>β</var>, it must pass through all intermediate ‘amounts’: i.&thinsp;e. all intermediate ‘amounts’ are ‘possible.’ <span class="after-hfill">[Ax.&nbsp;2.</span></p>

<p>Therefore either all Triangles have &amp;c.</p>

<h5>Corollaries.</h5>

<h6>1.</h6>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Among angular magnitudes there is one, and only one, ‘possible region.’</span></p>

<h6>2.</h6>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This ‘possible region’ either consists of one single angular magnitude, such that it, and it alone, is a ‘possible amount’; or it consists of a continuous series of angular magnitudes, lying between 2 ‘limits,’ which 2 limits are such that any magnitude, lying between them, is a ‘possible amount,’ and any magnitude, lying outside them, is an ‘impossible amount.’</span></p>

<h4>Prop.&nbsp;V. Theorem.</h4>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The angles of any Triangle are together less than three right angles.</span>
</p><hr class="medskip">

<p>Let a right angle be represented by ‘<var>R</var>.’</p>

<p>Now any 2 of the angles of a Triangle are together less than <math><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>R</mi></mrow></math>; <span class="after-hfill">[Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;17.</span></p>

<p>∴, adding together the 3 pairs which may be taken, the 3 angles of a Triangle, taken twice over, are together less than <math><mrow><mn>6</mn><mi>R</mi></mrow></math>;</p>

<p>∴, taken once only, they are together less than <math><mrow><mn>3</mn><mi>R</mi></mrow></math>.</p>

<p>Therefore the angles of any Triangle &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="after-hfill">Q.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;D.</span></p>

<h4>Prop.&nbsp;VI. Theorem.</h4>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">There is a Triangle whose angles are together not-greater than two right angles.</span>
</p><hr class="medskip">

<p>If we deny this, we must assert that any ‘amount’ is greater than <math><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>R</mi></mrow></math>.</p>

<p>Let this be our First Hypothesis.</p>

<p>Now any ‘amount’ is less than <math><mrow><mn>3</mn><mi>R</mi></mrow></math>. <span class="after-hfill">[Prop.&nbsp;5.</span></p>

<p>Hence the ‘possible region’ lies below <math><mrow><mn>3</mn><mi>R</mi></mrow></math>; i.&thinsp;e. it has a ‘superior limit.’</p>

<p>Now let a ‘possible amount’ be selected, more than halfway from <math><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>R</mi></mrow></math> to the ‘superior limit’ of this region; and call it ‘<math><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>R</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>α</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></math>.’ Then it is evident that ‘<math><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>R</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>α</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></math>’ will lie <i>above</i> this limit, and will therefore be an ‘impossible amount.’</p>

<p>Now any Triangle, whose ‘amount’ is <math><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>R</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>α</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></math>, must be either obtuse-angled, or right-angled, or acute-angled.</p>

<p>Hence we must assert that there is either an obtuse-angled Triangle, or a right-angled Triangle, or an acute-angled Triangle, whose ‘amount’ is <math><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>R</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>α</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></math>.</p>

<p>Let these be our Second, our Third, and our Fourth Hypothesis.</p>

<p>Then Triangle <math><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>C</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math> is equal, in all respects, to Triangle <math><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>C</mi><mi>A</mi></mrow></math>; <span class="after-hfill">[Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;4.</span></p>

<h3 id="appendix-ii">Appendix II.</h3>
<p class="subtitle">Is Euclid’s Axiom true?</p>

<h4>§ 1. Infinite and Finite Magnitudes</h4>

<p>The answer I propose to give to this alarming question is that, though true for Finite Magnitudes—the sense in which, as I believe, Euclid <i>meant it to be taken</i>—it is <i>not</i> universally true.</p>

<p>Will the gentle Reader be so kind as to join me in contemplating, for a few minutes, the Infinite Space which surrounds our tiny planet? We believe—those of us, at least, who answer <i>fully</i> to the ancient definition of Man, ‘<i>animal rationale</i>’—that it is infinite. And that, not because we profess to have grasped the conception of Infinity, but because the <i>contrary</i> hypothesis <i>contradicts</i> Reason: and what contradicts Reason we feel ourselves authorised to deny. <i>Both</i> conceptions—that Space has a limit, and that it has none—are <i>beyond</i> our Reason: but the former is also <i>against</i> our Reason: for we may fairly say “When we have reached the limit, what then? What do we come to? There <i>must</i> be either Something, or Nothing. If Something, it is <i>full</i> Space, ‘<i>plenum</i>’: if Nothing, it is <i>empty</i> Space, ‘<i>vacuum</i>.’ That there should be <i>neither</i> of these is a logical impossibility. Such an hypothesis would be—in the words of Master Constable Dogberry—<span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-6">‘most tolerable and not to be endured.’</span>”</p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-6"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> by William Shakespeare</aside>

<p>I propose to show, by certain considerations which begin with Infinite Space, but will speedily condescend to Finite Magnitudes, that it is possible for two homogeneous Magnitudes to be so related to each other that <i>no</i> multiple of the lesser will exceed the greater. (It is of course assumed that a ‘multiple’ of a Magnitude is the result produced by the use of a ‘multiplier,’ and that a ‘multiplier’ is a <i>nameable</i>—and therefore a <i>finite</i>—number.)</p>

<p>“Yet surely,” the gentle Reader will protest, “Euclid has assumed the exact <i>contrary</i> of this? Does he not, in Book&nbsp;X, Prop.&nbsp;1, tacitly assume the Axiom that the lesser of two Magnitudes may be so multiplied as to exceed the greater?”</p>

<p>Gentle Reader, he <i>does!</i> But <i>my</i> contention is that, in so doing, he excludes from his view both Infinities and Infinitesimals, and is contemplating <i>Finite Magnitudes only</i>.</p>

<p>For consider Euclid’s Definitions of the word ‘Ratio’ and of the phrase ‘to have a Ratio to.’ (Book&nbsp;V. Def.&nbsp;3, 4.)</p>

<p>(3) <span lang="grc">λόγος ἐστί δύο μεγεϑῶν ὁμογενῶν ἡ κατά πελικότητα πρὸς ἄλλελα ποιά σχέσις.</span></p>

<p>(4) <span lang="grc">λόγον ἔχειν πρὸς ἄλλελα μεγέϑη λέγεται, ἅ δύναται πολλαπλασιαζόμενα ἀλλήλων ὑπερέχειν.</span></p>

<p>Quite literally, these are:—</p>

<p>(3) “Ratio is a certain relationship, as to size, of two homogeneous Magnitudes, each to the other.”</p>

<p>(4) “Magnitudes, which can, (on) being multiplied, exceed each the other, are said to have a Ratio, each to the other.”</p>

<p>But they become more intelligible when less literally translated:—</p>

<p>(3) “Ratio is a certain relationship, as to size, borne, by a Magnitude, to another Magnitude homogeneous with it.”</p>

<p>(4) “A Magnitude is said ‘to bear a Ratio to’ another Magnitude, homogeneous with it, when either of them, that is not greater than the other, can be made so by multiplication.”</p>

<p>Some translators introduce the word ‘mutual’ into No.&nbsp;(3), and tell us that Ratio is ‘a <i>mutual</i> relation of two Magnitudes’: but this seems to me incorrect, as seeming to imply that the Ratio, borne by <var>A</var> to <var>B</var>, is <i>identical</i> with that borne by <var>B</var> to <var>A</var>. But, if <var>A</var> were 3-4ths of <var>B</var>, <var>B</var> would not be 3-4ths, but 4-3ds, of <var>A</var>: and the Ratio ‘4-3ds,’ though of the same <i>nature</i> as the Ratio ‘3-4ths,’ is not <i>identical</i> with it.</p>

<p>Now it seems to me clear that Euclid does not mean to imply that <i>any</i> two homogeneous Magnitudes bear ‘Ratios’ to each other: for in No.&nbsp;(4) he gives us a test, by which to know in what cases two such Magnitudes <i>do</i>, and in what cases they do <i>not</i>, bear ‘Ratios’ to each other. This test would be wholly superfluous if it were true, of any two homogeneous Magnitudes, that one could be said ‘to bear a Ratio to’ the other.</p>

<p>What cases then, does Euclid mean to <i>exclude</i> by this test? My answer is “all cases in which one of the Magnitudes is <i>infinitely greater than the other</i>.” Take, as an example, these two Magnitudes—a Cubic Inch, and Infinite Space. It is <i>not</i> possible, by multiplying a Cubic Inch by any finite number, however great, to make it exceed, or even equal, Infinite Space: hence Euclid’s test <i>fails</i> in this case, and Euclid would, no doubt, <i>decline</i> to say that either of these Magnitudes, though they are strictly <i>homogeneous</i>, bears a ‘Ratio’ to the other.</p>

<p>My conclusion, then, is that, in Book&nbsp;X. Prop.&nbsp;1, Euclid is limiting his view to the case of two homogeneous Magnitudes <i>which are such that neither of them is infinitely greater than the other</i>: nay, more—for such a limitation would not exclude the case of two Infinities of the same order—that he is contemplating <i>Finite Magnitudes only</i>.</p>

<h4>§ 2. Infinitesimal Lines and Strips.</h4>

<p>We have already seen that, in the case of two homogeneous Magnitudes, one Finite and the other Infinite, <i>no</i> multiple of the lesser will exceed the greater: and I now propose to show that it is possible for the same thing to happen in the case of two homogeneous Magnitudes, <i>neither of them being Infinite</i>.</p>

<p>Let us imagine an Infinite Plane, placed upright, and facing us—as if we were standing in front of a waU, which extended to infinity, upwards, downwards, to the right-hand, and to the left. If we divide this Plane by a single horizontal straight line, extended to infinity to the right-hand and to the left, we get <i>half</i> of the whole Plane <i>above</i> the Line, and <i>half below</i> it, wherever we choose to place the Line. This may be deduced from the logical principle that we have no reason for believing <i>either</i> to be greater than the other; or we may adopt M.&nbsp;Bertrand’s Axiom, “Two spaces, whether finite or infinite, are equal, when one can be placed upon the other so that any point whatsoever of either coincides with a point of the other”—a condition which seems, theoretically, readily attainable, by making one portion of the Plane revolve round the boundary-line, as a hinge, till it coincides with the other portion. Each portion is, of course, an Infinity of the <i>same</i> order as the whole Plane.</p>

<p>Now let us imagine <i>two</i> such infinite horizontal straight Lines, ‘separational’ from each other (i.&thinsp;e. never intersecting), placed at a finite distance apart, and therefore haying between them a Strip, finite in width, infinite in length, and therefore infinite in area.</p>

<p>Now it clearly is <i>not</i> possible, by multiplying this Infinite Strip by any finite number, however great, to make it exceed, or even equal, the whole Infinite-Plane. Here again, then, Euclid’s test fails, and neither of these Magnitudes, though they are <i>homogeneous</i>, can be said to have a ‘Ratio’ to the other. In fact, the Infinite-Strip is an Infinity <i>of a lower order</i> than the Infinite-Plane.</p>

<p>Comparing this Strip with a single square-inch, you will, I fancy, be willing to grant at once that <i>no</i> multiple of the latter can possibly reach—much less exceed—the former. We have, in fact, established the existence of <i>three</i> kinds of Area, viz. Finite Areas (e.&thinsp;g. a square inch). Infinities of the first order (e.&thinsp;g. the Infinite-Strip we have been considering), and Infinities of the second order (e.&thinsp;g. the upper half of the whole Infinite-Plane).</p>

<p>Now let us go a step further. Let the two sides of this Strip be supposed to gradually approach each other—still maintaining their ‘separational’ character—and let us consider the effect of this process on the intervening area.</p>

<p>When the width of the Strip has been reduced to half-an-inch, you will grant, I suppose, that the area is exactly half what it was at first—since <i>two</i> such Strips, laid side by side, evidently make up the original Strip. And so, by reducing the width to a quarter-inch, &amp;c., we obtain a number of different areas, all Infinite alike, and yet having finite ratios to one another: in fact, so long as the width continues to be a <i>finite fraction</i> (i.&thinsp;e. a fraction with a finite numerator and denominator) of an inch, the area continues to be an Infinity <i>of the same order</i> as the original Strip. (It seems obvious that Infinities <i>of the same order</i> have finite ratios to one another, and that any one of them can be so multiplied, by a finite number, as to exceed any other.)</p>

<p>But this narrowing process may be continued until the two Lines absolutely <i>coincide</i>: and what <i>then</i> becomes of the area? It cannot be denied that it is then <i>Zero</i>.</p>

<p>Now I have ventured (see <a href="#new-theory-parallels:a1">p.&nbsp;2</a>) to lay it down, as an Axiom, that, when a Magnitude varies <i>continuously</i>, and has changed from a certain value to a certain other value, it must have passed through <i>every intermediate value</i>. And what intermediate values do we find between an Infinite Area and Zero? Surely every <i>Finite</i> Area, that can be named, lies between them? The Reader can, if he likes, part company with me at this point: but to my Reason it seems absolutely clear—first, that the Strip does diminish <i>continously</i>, and not ‘<i>per saltum</i>’; and secondly, that its area has, at some time or other during the process, every conceivable <i>finite</i> value. At one time, for instance, it contains a square-mile: and, rather later in its career, it is reduced to a single <i>square-inch</i>.<span id="new-theory-parallels:strip"></span></p>

<p>Let us contemplate it in this last-named condition. Its length? As Infinite, clearly, as it was at first. Its Area? One square-inch, undoubtedly. <i>And what is its width?</i></p>

<p>Can you, oh gentle Reader, find any reasonable answer to this question, except the following? “Its width is <i>infinitely small</i>—having, in fact, exactly the same relation to a linear inch which that linear inch has to an infinite Line.”</p>

<p>If this be so (and I see no way out of it), we have found two Magnitudes, both linear, neither of them infinite, and yet <i>such that no multiple of the lesser can possibly exceed the greater</i>. They are, in fact, <i>not of the same order</i>; one of them being Finite, and the other an Infinitesimal of the first order.</p>

<p>But is not the gentle Reader saying to himself, all this time, “I <i>cannot</i> believe in the existence of a Strip, Infinite in length, and yet Finite in Area! No doubt, if such a Strip <i>could</i> exist, its width must be what you call ‘Infinitesimal’; since a Finite width must give an Infinite area. But I don’t believe in the existence of an Infinitesmal width! My belief is that, if you make the edges of the Infinite-Strip gradually approach till they coincide, its width will continue <i>Finite</i> till the last moment, and will then suddenly become Zero; and that its area will continue an <i>Infinity of the first order</i> till the last moment, and will then suddenly become Zero.”</p>

<p>Very good. My gentle Reader has formulated his views, very clearly and definitely. Permit me now to offer to his consideration a Strip, which I will <i>prove</i> to be at once Infinite in length and Finite in area.</p>

<p>Let <math><mrow><mi>O</mi><mi>X</mi></mrow></math>, <math><mrow><mi>O</mi><mi>Y</mi></mrow></math>, be rectangular Axes of Reference; and let us trace the Curve <math><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></msup></mrow></math>, where <math><mrow><mi>O</mi><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>O</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>A</mi><mi>D</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>D</mi><mi>G</mi></mrow></math> = unit-line. Hence, when <math><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>, <math><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math>; when <math><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math>, <math><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mrow></math>; when <math><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math>, <math><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></mrow></math>; when <math><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></math>, <math><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>8</mn></mfrac></mrow></math>; and so on. Hence the Curve is <math><mrow><mi>L</mi><mi>C</mi><mi>F</mi><mi>K</mi><mi>M</mi><mi>N</mi></mrow></math>. Also, however large <var>x</var> becomes, <var>y</var> can <i>never</i> be Zero; i.&thinsp;e. the Strip, intercepted between the Curve and the <var>x</var>-Axis, and bounded at the left-hand end by <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>O</mi></mrow></math>, is Infinite in length. And now let us estimate its area. Its first portion, <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>O</mi><mi>A</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></math>, is less than the rectangle <math><mrow><mi>O</mi><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>; its second portion is less than <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow></math>; and so on. Hence its area is less than (<math><mrow><mi>O</mi><mi>B</mi></mrow></math> + <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow></math> + &amp;c. for ever); i.&thinsp;e., is less than (1 + <math><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math> + <math><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math> + &amp;c. for ever); therefore, <i>a fortiori</i>, it is less than 2.</p>

<p>Now an area, which is less than ‘2,’ is surely <i>Finite</i>? Does the gentle Reader see any escape from admitting this? And, if he admits this, does he <i>still</i> maintain that the <i>width</i> of this Infinite-Strip (which obviously dwindles, as you go along the Strip, but never becomes Zero) <i>never ceases to be Finite</i>? Yet surely a Strip, Infinite in <i>length</i>, and <i>nowhere less than Finite in width</i>, must be <i>Infinite</i> in area?</p>

<p>In brief, I place before my gentle Reader that savouriest of Logical dishes, a <i>Trilemmia</i>! Either he must assert that a Strip, Infinite in length, and nowhere less than Finite in width, is only Finite in area; or he must assert that the <i>length</i> of this Strip is <i>Finite</i>, i.&thinsp;e. he must assert that <i>the Curve meets the <var>x</var>-Axis</i>; or else he must admit that its <i>width</i> ceases to be Finite without becoming Zero, i.&thinsp;e. he must admit that its width becomes <i>Infinitesimal</i>! Let him take his choice, and help himself. ‘May good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both!’</p>

<p>Now let us cut off, from the infinitely-long Strip named in <a href="#new-theory-parallels:strip">p.&nbsp;45</a>, whose area is a square-inch, a piece just an inch long. What will its area be? It is evident that no multiple of this short Strip can ever make up the infinitely-long Strip; that is, no multiple of its area can make up a square-inch. Hence its area must be an Infinitesimal of the first order.</p>

<p>But this Infinitesimal area, inconceivably small as it is, is nevertheless <i>greater than Zero</i>. Hence our continuously-diminishing Strip is bound, before reaching Zero, to pass through this singularly unassuming value. And, at that moment, <i>what will be its width</i>? Its length will be Infinite, as usual: its area will be an Infinitesimal of the first order: but its width cannot be an Infinitesimal of the same order as the previous width; for <i>that</i> would yield a finite area, as we have seen. What else, then, can it be but <i>an Infinitesimal of the second order</i>? A Line of such stupendous brevity that no finite multiple of it can even make up an Infinitesimal of the first order. Evidently we might repeat this process <i>ad libitum</i>, and so get Infinitesimals of the third order, the fourth order, and so on.</p>

<p>To sum up our results, so far. We see that a Line may be either Finite, or may extend to an Infinity of the first order, or may dwindle to an Infinitesimal of the first, second, or any order we choose: and that an Area may be either Finite, or may extend to an Infinity of the first order (an Infinite-Strip), or of the second order (e.&thinsp;g. the whole Infinite-Plane), or may dwindle to an Infinitesimal of any order we choose.</p>

<p>Now we may reasonably expect to find that all, that has been here said, is equally applicable to <i>any</i> kind of Magnitude that is capable of <i>continuous</i> increase and decrease. Let us consider, then, whether it is possible to have Infinitesimal <i>Angles</i> of the various orders.</p>

<h4>§ 3. Infinitesimal Angles and Sectors.</h4>

<p>For this purpose, let us return to our upright Infinite-Plane, and, taking some Point at random as a centre, let us imagine two Lines radiating from it (say at an angle of 45°), and both of them extended to infinity, and therefore having between them a Sector, finite in angular magnitude, infinite in length, and therefore infinite in area.</p>

<p>I named 45° as my specimen-angle, because it is the <i>one single angle</i>, other than a right angle, with which Society is acquainted. Enquire of some chatty traveller, who is relating his experiences of an Alpine Pass, what <i>slope</i> it was that he had to climb. “The ground sloped at an angle of forty-five,” he is sure to reply. Nay, I once met a gentleman who, on hearing it mentioned that the ‘dip’ of a certain river-bed was, in one place, “one in forty-five,” cautiously remarked “I suppose that means an angle of forty-five degrees?” Imagine a <i>river</i> sloping at that angle! And then imagine the labour of rowing <i>up</i> it, and the headlong, wild delight of rowing <i>down</i> it! But this is a digression.</p>

<p>Now it clearly <i>is</i> possible, this time, by multiplying this Infinite-Sector by a certain finite number, namely ‘8,’ to make it equal to the whole Infinite-Plane. Hence this Infinite-Sector is an Infinity <i>of the same order</i> as the whole Infinite-Plane; i.&thinsp;e. it is of the <i>second</i> order.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose that the two sides of this Infinite Sector gradually approach each other until they coincide. It cannot be denied that the area then becomes Zero. It has dwindled, then, from an Infinity of the second order (when its angular magnitude was <i>finite</i>), down to absolute Zero. And there seems no room to doubt that it has done this <i>continuously</i>, and not ‘per saltum.’ What values, then, has it gone through on the way? Can we reasonably doubt that it has gone through, first, all Infinities of the <i>first</i> order (during which process its angular magnitude would be an Infinitesimal of the <i>first</i> order), secondly, all <i>Finite</i> values (its angular magnitude being an Infinitesimal of the <i>second</i> order), thirdly, all Infinitesimals of the <i>first</i> order (its angular magnitude being an Infinitesimal of the <i>third</i> order), and so on—the angular magnitude being always <i>two</i> degrees ahead of the area, in this long and fatiguing competition in the Dwindling-Race.</p>

<h4>§ 4. Pairs of Lines.</h4>

<p>We are now in a position to examine the phenomena of intersection, or non-intersection, with regard to a Pair of Lines, by imagining one of them to revolve about a fixed Point.</p>

<figure style="max-width:30em;">
<img src="../../images/cm-i/23.svg" width="192" height="194" alt="A mathematical diagram as described in the text.">
</figure>

<p>Let <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>B</mi></mrow></math> be one of the 2 Lines: and let <math><mrow><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></math> be, at first, at right angles to it: and let it then revolve, about <var>V</var>, so as to take the successive positions <math><mrow><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math>, <math><mrow><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></mrow></math>, <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>V</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>, its final position being at right angles to its first position, and therefore parallel to <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>.</p>

<p>Let us further suppose that the angle, contained between <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>V</mi></mrow></math> and the upper part of the revolving Line, dwindles, from a right angle, through all possible <i>finite</i> lesser values, while its upper edge revolves from <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></math> to <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math>; that, the moment the upper edge goes <i>below</i> <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math>, this angle becomes an <i>Infinitesimal of the first degree</i>, and so dwindles, through all such values, while its upper edge revolves from <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> to <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></mrow></math>; that, the moment the upper edge goes <i>below</i> <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></mrow></math>, this angle becomes an <i>Infinitesimal of the second degree</i>; and so on.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose all the Lines in the diagram produced to infinity both ways: and let us call the Infinite-Sector, intercepted between <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></math>-produced and the upper part of the revolving-Line, ‘No.&nbsp;1’; the semi-Infinite-Strip (I mean, by ‘semi-Infinite,’ that it is terminated at <i>one</i> end), intercepted between the Lines <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></math>-produced and <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>A</mi></mrow></math>-produced, and bounded at the right-hand end by <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></math>, ‘No.&nbsp;2’; the surface, intercepted between the Line <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-produced and the lower part of the revolving-Line, and bounded at the left-hand end by <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></math>, (which will be a Triangle, so long as <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-produced and the lower part of the revolving-Line continue, to intersect, and will become a semi-Infinite-Strip when they cease to intersect,) ‘No.&nbsp;3’; and, with regard to the Infinite-Sector intercepted between the Line <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>-produced and the lower part of the revolving-Line, let us call that portion of it, which lies <i>above</i> <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-produced (which portion will be a semi-Infinite-Strip, so long as <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-produced and the lower part of the revolving-Line continue to intersect, and will become the whole Infinite-Sector if they should cease to intersect before the revolving-Line reaches the position <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>), ‘No.&nbsp;4’; and that portion of it, which lies <i>below</i> <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-produced (which portion will cease to exist as soon as these Lines cease to intersect) ‘No.&nbsp;5.’</p>

<p>Let us now investigate the changes, in the <i>areas</i> of these 5 surfaces, caused by the changes in the position of the revolving-Line.</p>

<p>First as to No.&nbsp;1. This is clearly, throughout its history, an Infinite-Sector, whose vertical-angle is at first a right angle, and ultimately Zero. Also its area is at first one-quarter of the whole Infinite-Plane, and ultimately Zero. Also, so long as the upper part of the revolving-Line ranges between <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></math> and <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math>, the area continues to be an Infinity of the second order; and, as the revolving-Line crosses the position <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math>, the area changes, from a very small (!) <i>Infinity of the second order</i>, to a very large <i>Infinity of the first order</i>. Similarly, as the revolving-Line crosses the position <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></mrow></math>, the area changes, from a very small <i>Infinity of the first order</i>, to a very large <i>Finite value</i>.</p>

<p>A little further on, it will of course become an <i>Infinitesimal of the first order</i>; and so on, through the other orders, till it finally reaches the value <i>Zero</i>.</p>

<p>Next, as to No.&nbsp;2. This is clearly, throughout its history, one-half of the Infinite-Strip contained between <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>B</mi></mrow></math> and <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>, and is therefore an <i>Infinity of the first order</i>. Its area is a constant quantity, being unaffected by the revolving-Line.</p>

<p>Next, as to Nos.&nbsp;4, 5. (I take these next, because they will help us to investigate the properties of No.&nbsp;3.) It is evident that, so long as No.&nbsp;5 continues to exist, the two together constitute—and that, when No.&nbsp;5 has ceased to exist. No.&nbsp;4 by itself constitutes—an Infinite-Sector, which is the exact counterpart of No.&nbsp;1—the two having what Euclid calls ‘opposite vertical angles.’ Hence, while the lower part of the revolving-Line ranges between <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></math> and <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math>, the area of No.&nbsp;4 continues to be an Infinity of the second order, and entirely declines to be <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-7">‘cribb’d, cabin’d, and confined’</span> within such narrow limits as our Infinite-Strip! Hence the revolving-Line continues, all this time, to intersect <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-produced. (N.B. Here we have a proof of the truth of Euclid’s Axiom, when amended, as I have done at <a href="#new-theory-parallels:prop-x">p.&nbsp;28</a>, by inserting the words ‘the defect being a finite angle.’)</p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-7"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>Macbeth</i> by William Shakespeare</aside>

<p>Let us now, reserving for future consideration the phenomena of the period while the upper part of the revolving-Line is crossing from <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> to <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></mrow></math> suppose it to have passed <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></mrow></math>, so that the angle, which it makes with <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></math>, has become an Infinitesimal of the <i>second</i> order. Will its lower part continue to intersect <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>-produced? It may easily be shown, by a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, that it will <i>not</i>: for, if it did, Nos.&nbsp;1, 2, 3 would then make up an Infinite-Sector, whose vertical angle would be an Infinitesimal of the <i>second</i> order, and whose area would therefore be <i>finite</i>. But the area of No.&nbsp;2 is always an <i>Infinity</i> of the first order. Which is absurd. Hence, after the upper part of the revolving-Line has passed <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></mrow></math>, its lower part does <i>not</i> intersect <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-produced.</p>

<p>We have now to answer a far more puzzling question, namely, what happens while the upper part of the revolving-Line is crossing from <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> to <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></mrow></math>? Does its lower part intersect <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-produced, all the while? Or does it fall clear of it, all the while? Or does it at first intersect it, and afterwards cease to do so?</p>

<p>First, suppose it to intersect <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-prodnced. In this case No.&nbsp;3 is clearly a closed Triangle, whose vertical-angle is an Infinitesimal of the first order. This looks as if its <i>area</i> must also be an Infinitesimal of the first order: but this, we know, <i>cannot</i> be, since it contains within it the finite area possessed by No.&nbsp;3 while the upper part of the revolving-Line was passing from <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></math> to <math><mrow><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math>, Hence its area must be, at least, <i>finite</i>. The only way I can see out of this difficulty is to assume that the <i>sides</i> of this Triangle have become <i>infinite</i>; i.&thinsp;e. that the revolving-Line intersects <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-produced at <i>an infinite distance</i>.</p>

<p>Next, suppose it to fall clear of <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-prodnced, In this case No.&nbsp;3 is a semi-Infinite-Strip, but we cannot be certain that its <i>area</i> is, like such Strips when of a uniform width, <i>infinite</i>; for its width dwindles so much towards the right-hand that it may possibly be, in the early part of the period, <i>finite</i>. I see no way of settling this question; but, luckily, it is not relevant to the question of <i>intersection</i>.</p>

<p>My own inclination is to believe that, during this second period of revolution, the lower part of the revolving-Line at first intersects <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-produced, at an infinite distance, and then ceases to intersect it.</p>

<p>After the revolving-Line has once ceased to intersect <math><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>-produced, No.&nbsp;4 is of course equal to No.&nbsp;1. That is to say, the surface, contained between the whole revolving-Line and <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>, is, from that moment until the revolving-Line coincides with <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>, of a constant area, since it is the sum-total of Nos.&nbsp;1, 2, 3, which is equal to the sum-total of Nos.&nbsp;2, 3, 4, i.&thinsp;e. to the whole Infiinite-Strip. And this will continue true, while No.&nbsp;1 and No.&nbsp;4 dwindle down, through all finite and infinitesimal values, till they finally reach Zero.</p>

<p>The results we have arrived at will perhaps be more easily understood by examining the following Table of values. The symbols used in it are as follows:—

If a Pair of Lines make, with a certain transversal, two interior angles on the same side of it together less than two right angles, then, so long as the defect is <i>finite</i>, there is no doubt that the Lines intersect: also, if the theory be true, that the area of an Infinite-Sector, whose vertical-angle is finite, and whose area is therefore undoubtedly an Infinity of the second order, passes, as its vertical angle dwindles to Zero, through infinite values of the first order, and then through finite values, its vertical angle meanwhile passing through infinitesimal values of the first and second order—if all this be true, it follows that, when the ‘defect from two right angles’ becomes an Infinitesimal of the <i>first</i> order, the Lines may possibly intersect, but can only do so at an infinite distance; and that, when the defect has become an Infinitesimal of the <i>second</i> order, the Lines have ceased to intersect.</p>

<p>The theory, here discussed, may be bewildering; but it is at least consistent with itself: and it seems to me to be <i>quite</i> as credible as the theory that ‘Infinitesimals’ are mythical, and that a Finite Magnitude, dwindling down to Zero, continues Finite to its last gasp.</p>

<p>Another process—a <i>negative</i> one—has occurred to me, for disproving the <i>absolute</i> truth of Euclid’s Axiom. It is a very simple process, and has the great recommendation of not requiring any belief in the existence of Infinitesimals.</p>

<p>On an upright Infinite-Plane let us suppose 2 horizontal Infinite-Lines, having a common perpendicular, and therefore of course never intersecting. Let us call them ‘No.&nbsp;1’ and ‘No.&nbsp;2,’ No.&nbsp;1 being above No.&nbsp;2: and let us suppose the common perpendicular to be an inch long, so that the 2 Lines are the edges of an Infinite-Strip, whose uniform width is an inch.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose Line No.&nbsp;1 to begin to revolve about the upper end of the common perpendicular. The believer in the <i>absolute</i> truth of Euclid’s Axiom is bound to believe that, <i>in the very act of beginning to revolve</i>, it also begins to intersect No.&nbsp;2: he cannot allow the one process any such <i>start</i> of the other as might enable him to say “No.&nbsp;1 has begun to revolve, but has <i>not</i> yet begun to intersect No.&nbsp;2”: such a state of things <i>must</i> be, in <i>his</i> view, <i>absolutely</i> impossible. ‘And what’s impossible ca’n’t be. And never never comes to pass!’</p>

<p>Very good. The actual process of <i>beginning</i> to intersect No.&nbsp;2 is a deep mystery, no doubt: but that the thing <i>happens</i> is quite undeniable. We are able to say “Now it <i>isn’t</i> intersecting No.&nbsp;2—and now it is!” So, though we cannot conceive <i>how</i> it managed to begin, it has certainly <i>done</i> it.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose <i>another</i> horizontal Line, ‘No.&nbsp;3,’ lying an inch below No.&nbsp;2. The believer in Euclid’s Axiom is bound to assert, as to No.&nbsp;3, <i>exactly</i> what he asserted as to No.&nbsp;2. Has he, then, any logical escape from the conclusion that the revolving Line begins to intersect Nos.&nbsp;2 and 3 <i>together</i>? I see none, myself. And yet how can it get at No.&nbsp;3, without <i>first</i> going through No.&nbsp;2? <i>Any</i> point on No.&nbsp;1 (I am careful not to say ‘every’: I know how gleefully the logical Reader would swoop down upon me with the crushing sarcasm “What does ‘every’ mean, when there is no limit to the number of points?”: but ‘any’ is a safe epithet) is amenable to the simple rule of “First come, first served. Cross No.&nbsp;2 first: and <i>afterwards</i> (not by any means <i>simultaneously</i>) you have our gracious permission to cross No.&nbsp;3.” Now, what is true of <i>any</i> point on the Infinite-Line No.&nbsp;1 is surely true of that Infinite-Line itself? To say “No.&nbsp;1 intersects No.&nbsp;3” is tantamount to saying “A certain <i>point</i> of No.&nbsp;1 has reached No.&nbsp;3.” And <i>how did that Point get below No.&nbsp;2</i>?</p>

<p>Of two things, one. Either <i>some</i> point of No.&nbsp;1 has crossed Nos.&nbsp;2 and 3 <i>at the same moment</i>: or else <i>no</i> point of No.&nbsp;1 has crossed No.&nbsp;3 until <i>after</i> it had crossed No.&nbsp;2. That is a logical Dilemma. Which of its two horns does the Reader prefer?</p>

<p>The choice of the <i>first</i> horn involves the Reader’s acceptance of <i>ubiquitous points</i>! In the event of his choosing the <i>second</i> horn, he seems logically bound to admit it as a <i>possible</i> state of things, that No.&nbsp;1 should have <i>begun</i> to revolve, and yet should <i>not</i> have begun to intersect No.&nbsp;3—which is a surrender of his belief in the <i>universal</i> truth of Euclid’s Axiom.</p>

<p>My final answer, then, to the question “<i>Is Euclid’s Axiom true?</i>” is as follows:—</p>

<p>“If the defect, from the sum of two right angles, be <i>finite</i>, the Lines <i>certainly meet</i>; if it be an Infinitesimal of the <i>first</i> order, they may meet, or not, according to circumstances: if it be an Infinitesimal of the <i>second</i>, third, or any higher order, they <i>certainly do not meet</i>.”</p>

<p>The question, with which this Appendix is headed, was sufficiently startling: but a more startling one remains to be answered. “If Euclid’s Axiom be not <i>universally</i> true, what becomes of all the Propositions which he has made to depend upon it, such as I.&nbsp;29? Has he done no more than prove them to be <i>partially</i> true?”</p>

<p>To this disheartening question I will give as re-assuring an answer as the case seems to admit of. It must be admitted that Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;29 requires—if we would make it <i>strictly</i> true—the same limitation as the Axiom: it should run as follows:—“Two Lines, which do not meet, make, with all transversals, angles which are equal <i>so far as finite differences are concerned</i>” (i.&thinsp;e. angles so nearly equal that the difference, if any, is <i>infinitesimal</i>). And of course Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32, as proved from Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;29, would need a similar qualification. It seems to me very doubtful whether Euclid ever noticed this defect in his Axiom. If he did, it is possible that he may have thought fit to ignore it, on the ground that, when Finite Magnitudes differ only by an Infinitesimal, they are, for all <i>practical</i> purposes, equal.</p>

<p>But I feel bound to admit that, for the purpose of proving Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32 to be, as it really is, <i>universally</i> true, neither Euclid’s Axiom, nor any other that deals with <i>intersection</i> of Lines, will suffice: and that some Axiom, not involving that principle, must be substituted for it.
</p><hr class="medskip">

<p>Let me say in conclusion that, though I assert the <i>ahsolute</i> truth of Euclid’s Axiom—with the limiting clause I have introduced, ‘<i>the defect being a finite angle</i>’—it still remains, in my opinion, a ‘disputable’ Axiom; i.&thinsp;e. it is not properly admissible as an <i>Axiom</i>, but ought to be, if possible, proved as a <i>Theorem</i>.</p>

<p class="subtitle">How should Parallels be defined?</p>

<p>We know that, if a, Pair of Lines has either of the following properties
</p><div class="continue"><div class="verse">
<p>(1) they are equally inclined to a certain transversal,<br>
(2) one of them contains 2 Points on the same side of, and equidistant from, the other,
</p></div></div>
<p class="continue">it has all the following properties
</p><div class="continue"><div class="verse">
<p>(3) they are equally inclined to all transversals,<br>
(4) any 2 Points, on either of them, are on the same side of, and equidistant from, the other,<br>
(5) they do not meet, however far produced.
</p></div></div>

<p>Any one of these properties may he used as a Definition. Let us take them one by one.</p>

<p>No.&nbsp;(1). This has the advantage that we need not hegin by proving that such Lines <i>exist</i>, but may assume it as axiomatic. It has been used as a Definition by Varignon, Bezout, Cooley, &amp;c.: at least, they say “which make equal angles with a transversal,” leaving it uncertain whether they mean “a <i>certain</i> transversal” or “<i>any</i> transversal”: if the latter, it is of course No.&nbsp;(3) they are proposing to use. From No.&nbsp;1 we can prove No.&nbsp;(5) without using any disputable Axiom (see Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;27, 28), but not No.&nbsp;3 or No.&nbsp;4.</p>

<p>No.&nbsp;(2). This has the same advantage as No.&nbsp;(1). It has been used as a Definition by D’Alembert. From <i>it</i>, also, we can prove No.&nbsp;(5) without using any disputable Axiom; and it, also, fails to prove No.&nbsp;3 or No.&nbsp;4.</p>

<p>No.&nbsp;(3). This cannot be used, as a Definition, till we have proved that such Lines <i>exist</i>—which has not yet been done without employing some disputable Axiom. If Varignon, &amp;c. mean <i>this</i> to be their Definition, they are assuming the <i>existence</i> of such Lines,—a <i>very</i> un-axiomatic Axiom. But, when once their <i>existence</i> has been granted, or proved, No.&nbsp;4 can be deduced.</p>

<p>No.&nbsp;(4). This cannot be used, as a Definition, till we have proved that such Lines <i>exist</i>—which has not yet been done without employing some disputable axiom. When once their <i>existence</i> has been granted, or proved, No.&nbsp;3 can be deduced. No.&nbsp;4 has been used as a Definition by Wolf, Boscovich, T.&nbsp;Simpson, and Bonnycastle.</p>

<p>No.&nbsp;(5). This has the advantage that it is easy to prove (as in Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;27, 28) that such Lines <i>exist</i>. It has been used as a Definition by Euclid and a host of other geometers. It has, however, the enormous <i>dis</i>advantage that, whereas Nos.&nbsp;(3), (4), give us a <i>unique</i> Pair of Lines (e.&thinsp;g. given a Line and a Point not on it, we can prove that only <i>one</i> Line can be drawn, through the Point, such that the Pair shall have property No.&nbsp;(3)), No.&nbsp;(5) does <i>not</i>: on the contrary, given a Line and a Point not on it, a whole ‘pencil’ of Lines may be drawn, through the Point, and not meeting the given Line: all we need to do is to take care, after drawing <i>one</i> such Line, that the others shall make with it angles which are <i>Infinitesimals of the second order with regard to a right angle</i>.</p>

<p>We see, then, that the word “Parallels” has been already used with <i>four</i>, and possibly with <i>five</i>, different meanings: so that any fresh writer, who uses the word, is liable to be misunderstood unless he first defines it. The derivation of the word would seem to suggest No.&nbsp;(4) as its Definition; but Euclid’s adoption of No.&nbsp;(5) has led to that being the popular meaning attached to the word.</p>

<p>It is easy, however, to avoid all this ambiguity by the use of new terms. Rejecting Nos.&nbsp;(1) and (2), as useless for the purpose of definition, we may call a Pair of Lines, which possesses<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>No.&nbsp;(3), “equiangulated”;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>No.&nbsp;(4), “equidistantial”;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>No.&nbsp;(5), “separational”;<br>
and thus avoid the dangerous word “parallel” altogether.</p>

<p>My own belief is that No.&nbsp;(3) is, on the whole, the property best adapted for practical use as a Definition.</p>

<p class="subtitle">How the Question stands to-day.</p>

<p>I will first enumerate certain Theorems connected with Pairs of Lines.</p>

<p>I will then notice three other methods which have been suggested for superseding Euclid’s Axiom.</p>

<p>And, in conclusion, I will indicate what seem to me the most hopeful directions for future efforts at exploring this fascinating, but very obscure, region of mathematical research.</p>

<h4>§ 1. Certain universally-true Theorems, provable from genuine Axioms (i.&thinsp;e. from Axioms whose self-evident character is indisputable).</h4>

<p>(1) A Pair of Lines, which are equally inclined to a certain transversal, are separational (i.&thinsp;e. never intersect, however far produced). [Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;27, 28.]</p>

<p>(2) [<i>contranominal of</i> (1)] A Pair of intersectional Lines (i.&thinsp;e. which either intersect or would do so if produced) are unequally inclined to any transversal. [Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;16, 17.]</p>

<p>(3) A Pair of Lines, such that two Points on one of them are on the same side of, and equidistant from, the other, are separational.</p>

<p>(4) [<i>contranominal of</i> (3)] A Pair of intersectional Lines are non-equidistantial (i.&thinsp;e. are such that any two Points on either of them, which are on the same side of the other, are non-equidistant from it, that which is further from the Point of intersection being also further from the other Line).</p>

<p>(5) If there be a Triangle whose angles are together equal to two right angles: the angles of any Triangle are together equal to two right angles.</p>

<p>(6) There is a Triangle whose angles are together not-greater than two right angles.</p>

<h4>§ 2. Certain universally-true Theorems, not provable from genuine Axioms, but provable if any one of them be accepted as an Axiom.</h4>

<p>[N.B. These will be hereafter referred to as the ‘Nine Quasi-Axioms,’ their self-evident character being disputable.]
</p><hr class="medskip">

<p>(1) Through a given Point, outside a given Line, a Line may be drawn, such that the Pair shall be equally inclined to any transversal.</p>

<p>(2)<span id="new-theory-parallels:2-2"></span> A Pair of Lines, which are equally inclined to a certain transversal, are so to any transversal. [Deducible from Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;27, 28, 29.]</p>

<p>(3) [<i>contranominal of</i> (2)] A pair of Lines, which are unequally inclined to a certain transversal, are so to any transversal.</p>

<p>(4) If a Point move so as to be at a constant distance from a given Line, its path shall be a straight Line.</p>

<p>*(5) Through a given Point, outside a given Line, a Line may be drawn equidistantial from the given Line (i.&thinsp;e. such that any two Points on it shall be equidistant from the given Line).</p>

<p>(6) A Pair of Lines, such that two Points on one of them are on the same side of, and equidistant from, the other, are equidistantial (i.&thinsp;e. are such that any two Points on either of them are equidistant from the other).</p>

<p>(7) [<i>contranominal of</i> (6)] A Pair of Lines, such that two Points on one of them are non-equidistant from the other, are non-equidistantial (i.&thinsp;e. are such that any two Points on either of them, which are on the same side of the other, are non-equidistant from the other).</p>

<p>*(8) A Line cannot recede from and then approach another; nor can it approach and then recede from another while on the same side of it.</p>

<p>*(9) In any Circle, the inscribed equilateral Tetragon is greater than any one of the Segments which lie outside it.
</p><hr class="bigskip">

<p>If any one of these 9 Theorems be granted as an Axiom, the rest can be proved from it. But only 3 of them, so far as I know, have been used as Axioms—No.&nbsp;5 by Clavius, No.&nbsp;8 by Dr.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Simson, and No.&nbsp;9 by myself. Clavius’ Axiom requires us to assure ourselves that it will continue true when the Lines are produced <i>without limit</i>; and the strain on the imagination, caused by the effort of following them into Infinite Space, is one to be, if possible, avoided. Dr.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Simson’s Axiom gains a certain plausibility from the fact that, for <i>intersecting</i> Lines, it admits of actual <i>proof</i> (see §&nbsp;1.&nbsp;(4)): where, however, the Lines are <i>not</i> known to intersect, it is an appeal to the eye, of <i>very</i> doubtful force.</p>

<h4>§ 3. Certain universally-true Theorems, not provable from genuine Axioms, but provable if any one of the ‘Nine Quasi-Axioms’ be accepted.</h4>

<p>(1) There is a finite angular magnitude such that the angles of any Triangle are together not-less than it.</p>

<p>(2) There is a Triangle whose angles are together not-less than two right angles.</p>

<p>(3) There is a Triangle whose angles are together equal to two right angles.</p>

<p>(4) The angles of any Triangle are together equal to two right angles. [Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32.]</p>

<h4>§ 4. Certain partially-true Theorems, not provable from any universally-true Aocioms, whether genuine or ‘quasi,’ but provable if any one of themselves be accepted as an Axiom.</h4>

<p>[N.B. By ‘partially-true’ is meant ‘true for <i>finite</i> magnitudes.’ They become universally-true, if ‘magnitude’ be taken to mean ‘<i>finite</i> magnitude’; ‘equal’ to mean ‘not differing by a <i>finite</i> difference’; ‘unequal’ to mean ‘differing by a <i>finite</i> difference’; ‘multiplied’ to mean ‘multiplied by a <i>finite</i> number’; and ‘intersectional’ to mean ‘intersectional at a <i>finite</i> angle.’</p>

<p>These Theorems will be hereafter referred to as the ‘Nine Pseudo-Axioms,’ the name being chosen to indicate that they are not even universally <i>true</i>—far less <i>self-evident</i>.]
</p><hr class="medskip">

<p>(1) The lesser of two homogeneous Magnitudes may be so multiplied as to exceed the greater.</p>

<p>(2) A Pair of Lines, which are unequally inclined to a certain transversal, are interseetional. [Euclid’s Axiom.]</p>

<p>(3) [<i>contranominal of</i> (2)] A Pair of separational Lines are equally inclined to any transversal. [Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;29.]</p>

<p>(4) A Pair of Lines, such that two Points on one of them are non-equidistant from the other, are intersectional.</p>

<p>(5) [<i>contranominal of</i> (4)] A Pair of separational Lines are equidistantial.</p>

<p>(6) On either of two interseetional Lines a Point may be found, whose distance from the other Line shall exceed any assigned length.</p>

<p>(7) On either of two interseetional Lines a Point may be found, such that the distance, from its projection on the other Line to the point of intersection of the two Lines, shall exceed any assigned length.</p>

<p>(8) A Pair of interseetional Lines cannot be, both of them, separational from a third Line.</p>

<p>(9) [<i>contranominal of</i> (8)] A Pair of Lines, which are, both of them, separational from a third Line, are not interseetional.
</p><hr class="medskip">

<p>Six of these have been used as Axioms, viz.&nbsp;(2), which is Euclid’s celebrated Axiom; (4), by T.&nbsp;Simpson; (6), by Proclus; (7), by Franceschini; (8), by Ludlam, Playfair, &amp;c.; (1), by Legendre, in the 12th Volume of the ‘Memoirs of the Institute,’ being his “latest attempt” (I quote from De Morgan’s article on Parallels in Knight’s Cyclopaedia) “at the solution of the problem.” He only succeeds, however, in proving Prop.&nbsp;6 at p.&nbsp;10 of this book, and in proving that Prop.&nbsp;8, at p.&nbsp;26, follows logically from Prop.&nbsp;4, at p.&nbsp;22. In order to prove Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32, he introduces the principle of Limits and Vanishing Quantities, which takes us at once into the region of Infinities and Infinitesimals. But a greater success than this has, I understand, rewarded some recent investigations made by Professor J.&nbsp;Cook Wilson, of Oriel College, Oxford, who has deduced Euclid’s 12th Axiom from No.&nbsp;(1) of this Section.</p>

<p>In all these systems, however, including Euclid’s, the deductions, from the proposed Axiom, labour under the same defect as the Axiom itself, that is, they are only <i>partially</i>, and not <i>universally</i>, true.</p>

<h4>§ 5. Other methods of treatment.</h4>

<p>Three other methods of treating this subject call for notice.</p>

<p>Playfair and (more recently) Wilson have tried to deduce the properties of Parallels (and thence Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32) from the idea of <i>sameness of direction</i>, as predicated of two non-coincidental Lines (i.&thinsp;e. which do not lie in one and the same straight Line).</p>

<p>The foundation-stones of this Theory—without which it has no <i>raison d’être</i> whatever—are the two Axioms, which must necessarily be <i>somewhere</i> assumed, whether expressly or tacitly, first, that it is possible for non-coincident Lines to have ‘the same direction’; and secondly, that Lines, which have the same direction, make equal angles with all transversals.</p>

<p>Before discussing the first of these two Axioms, permit me to remind the Reader that the question before us is not “is it <i>true</i>?” but “is it <i>axiomatic</i>?”, that is, ‘does the average human intellect <i>accept</i> it as true, <i>without proof</i>?’ It is a question in Mental Physiology rather than in Geometry. The 47th Proposition of Euclid is quite as <i>true</i> as the Axiom ‘things that are equal to the same are equal to one another’; but the average human intellect, while accepting the latter without proof, does most certainly demand a good deal of proof before it will accept the former. Intellectual beings may conceivably exist, to whom Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;47 is axiomatic; but our books are not written for <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>Now there is one preliminary step, that is absolutely indispensable before the human intellect can accept any Axiom whatever: and that is, it must attach some <i>meaning</i> to it. We cannot, rationally, either assent to, or deny, any Proposition the words of which convey to us no idea.</p>

<p>AVe have, then, <i>two</i> questions to answer: first, “what <i>idea</i> is conveyed to the average human intellect by the phrase ‘<i>in the same direction</i>,’ when applied to non-coincident Lines?”, secondly, “in accepting the Axiom, that ‘Lines, which have the same direction, make equal angles with all transversals,’ to what other assertions arc we committing ourselves?”</p>

<p>If we contemplate a fixed Point in a Plane, and imagine one or more Lines passing through it, it is not difficult to grasp the following ideas—that the ‘direction’ of any such Line is that property of it which determines its <i>position</i>, now that one Point in it is already fixed—that any <i>two</i> such Lines form 4 angles, whose common vertex is the fixed Point—that, if one of those 4 angles he zero, the 2 Lines <i>coincide</i>; if not, they <i>intersect</i>—that, in the first case, they have <i>the same direction</i>, in the second, <i>different directions</i>—and that the difference of the directions of such Lines is measured by <i>the angle between them</i>.</p>

<p>But these ideas are of little use to us, when confronted with a given Line and a given Point <i>outside</i> it, and when told to imagine a new Line drawn, through the given Point, and ‘<i>in the same direction</i>’ as the given Line, the 2 Lines having no common Point. For the directions of the Lines are no longer <i>directly comparable</i>. There is no use in asking “do they contain a zero-angle?” when they contain no angle <i>whatever</i>. An angle cannot exist without a <i>vertex</i>: and <i>where is the vertex</i>?</p>

<p>What idea, then, is conveyed to the mind by the phrase “these Lines have <i>the same direction</i>”? If they were finite Lines, and the question concerned sameness of <i>length</i>, the process, of grasping this idea, would be a very simple one. We could either imagine one of the 2 Lines laid upon the other, and then apply the Axiom ‘magnitudes which coincide are equal’: or we could imagine a movable third Line, first applied to one of the 2 Lines and ascertained to have ‘<i>the same length</i>’ with it, and then carried across the intervening space and applied to the other Line; and, on finding it to have ‘the same length’ with <i>that</i> also, we should pronounce the 2 Lines to have ‘the same length,’ in full confidence that our movable Line had preserved its length <i>unchanged during the journey</i>.</p>

<p>Can we, then, use a similar process in grasping the idea of sameness of <i>direction</i>? That is, can we imagine a movable third Line, first applied to one of the 2 Lines and ascertained to have ‘<i>the same direction</i>’ with it, and then carried across the intervening space and applied to the second Line, to see if it has ‘<i>the same direction</i>’ with <i>it</i> also? But this process would convey to the mind no idea of ‘<i>sameness of direction</i>,’ unless we had some guarantee that the movable Line had preserved its direction <i>unchanged during the journey</i>. The only process, for securing this, that presents itself to my mind, is to imagine a <i>transversal</i>, cutting the 2 Lines, and thus bridging over the intervening space, and then to imagine the movable Line shifted along it, so as always to cut it <i>at a constant angle</i>.</p>

<p>I have thought this matter out very carefully, and I feel convinced that <i>this</i> is the mental process by which we grasp the idea of ‘<i>sameness of direction</i>,’ when predicated of Lines that have no common Point, and therefore cannot be said to contain a zero-angle.</p>

<p>Now this ‘constant angle’ is of course the angle at which the transversal cuts the first Line. Hence, the mental picture of a Line moving away from another, and yet maintaining ‘<i>sameness of direction</i>’ with it, is the picture of its so moving as that a certain transversal shall cut the two Lines <i>at the same angle</i>. And this is my answer to our <i>first</i> question, namely, “what idea is conveyed to the average human intellect by the phrase ‘<i>in the same direction</i>,’ when applied to non-coincident Lines?”</p>

<p>If this be granted, our <i>second</i> question, “in accepting the Axiom that ‘Lines, which have the same direction, make equal angles with all transversals,’ to what other assertions are we committing ourselves?”, must be answered “we are consciously committing ourselves to the assertion that Lines, which make equal angles with a certain transversal, <i>make equal angles with all transversals</i>.”</p>

<p>We see, then, that, if this be so, the advocates of the Direction-Thcory have not escaped the necessity of assuming, as axiomatic, the second Theorem enuntiated in §&nbsp;2. (See p.&nbsp;63.)</p>

<p>I must ask the Reader’s pardon for this long digression: but the fallacy, which (as I believe) lies at the root of the Direction-Theory, is a very subtle one, and has cost me a great many hours of hard thinking to un-earth it.
</p><hr class="medskip">

<p>Yet another process has been invented—quite fascinating in its brevity and its elegance—which, though involving the same fallacy as the Direction-Theory, proves Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32 without even mentioning the dangerous word ‘Direction.’</p>

<figure style="max-width:25em;">

<p>We are told to take any Triangle <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>B</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></math>; to produce <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>A</mi></mrow></math> to <var>D</var>; to make part of <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>, viz. <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>, revolve, about <var>A</var>, into the position <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>B</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow></math>; then to make part of this Line, viz. <math><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow></math>, revolve, about <var>B</var>, into the position <math><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>C</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></math>; and lastly to make part of this Line, viz. <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></math>, revolve, about <var>C</var>, till it lies along <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>, of which it originally formed a part. We are then assured that it must have revolved through 4 right angles: from which it easily follows that the interior angles of the Triangle are together equal to 2 right angles.</p>

<p>The disproof of this fallacy is almost as brief and elegant as the fallacy itself. We first quote the general principle that we cannot reasonably be told to make a Line fulfil <i>two</i> conditions, either of which is enough by itself to fix its position: e.&thinsp;g. given 3 Points, <var>X</var>, <var>Y</var>, <var>Z</var>, we cannot reasonably be told to draw a Line, from <var>X</var>, which shall pass through <var>Y</var> <i>and</i> <var>Z</var>: we can make it pass through <var>Y</var>, but it must then take its chance of passing through <var>Z</var>; and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose that, while one part of <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow></math>, viz. <math><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow></math>, revolves into the position <math><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></math>, another little bit of it, viz. <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>G</mi></mrow></math>, revolves, through an equal angle, into the position <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>H</mi></mrow></math>; and that, while <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></math> revolves into the position of lying along <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>, <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>H</mi></mrow></math> revolves—and here comes the fallacy. You must not say “revolves, through an equal angle, into the position of lying along <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>,” for this would be to make <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>H</mi></mrow></math> <i>fulfil two conditions at once</i>. If you say that the one condition involves the other, you are virtually asserting that the Lines <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></math>, <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>H</mi></mrow></math> are equally inclined to <math><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></math>—and this in <i>consequence</i> of <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>H</mi></mrow></math> having been so drawn that these same Lines are equally inclined to <math><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>E</mi></mrow></math>, That is, you are asserting §&nbsp;2.&nbsp;(2). (See <a href="#new-theory-parallels:2-2">p.&nbsp;63</a>.)

<p>One other proof—a very beautiful one, though largely dealing with Infinities and Infinitesimals—may here be mentioned, that of M.&nbsp;Bertrand. It rests on the principle that an infinite <i>Sector</i> (with a vertical angle which has a finite ratio to a right angle) is an Infinity of the <i>same</i> order as an infinite Plane, whereas an infinite <i>Strip</i> (i.&thinsp;e. the area contained between 2 ‘separational’ Lines) is an Infinity of a <i>lower</i> order. Hence he concludes that no such Sector, however small its vertical angle, will lie wholly between 2 such ‘separational’ Lines, however far apart: hence, if a Line intersect one of 2 ‘separational’ Lines, it must, if produced, intersect the other. He thus proves the Theorem numbered (8) in §&nbsp;4: but his results are, of course, only <i>partially</i>, and not <i>absolutely</i>, true.</p>

<p>As a rather interesting example of the ease with which an unwary explorer may tumble into a pit-fall, I may refer to a “Note on Euclid’s 12th Axiom” by a Mr.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Hanna, which will be found at p.&nbsp;27 of Vol.&nbsp;XIII of “Mathematical Questions” reprinted from the “Educational Times.” Mr.&nbsp;Hanna takes two Lines, situated as in Euclid’s Axiom, and drops a perpendicular, from a point on one, upon the other: from the foot of this he drops a second perpendicular back upon the first line: and so on, backwards and forwards, till the diagram slightly resembles the side of a laced-up boot. He then easily proves that these perpendiculars continually decrease in length. From this he infers that “the perpendicular will ultimately become less than any assignable line”! The fallacy is really too obvious to be worth pointing out.
</p><hr class="medskip">

<p>Another writer in the “Educational Times” (Mr.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Walmsley, B.A.: his article will be found at p.&nbsp;103 of Vol.&nbsp;XVII of the Reprint) has fallen into a rather less obvious trap. He endeavours to prove that “any straight line, perpendicular to one of two parallel straight lines, will meet the other.” (This, if it could be proved without assuming any disputable Axiom, would indeed be a splendid success! Mr.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Walmsley has hardly realised, as yet, the <i>fearful</i> difficulty of persuading two Lines, under any conceivable circumstances, to do such a thing as “meet.” Whether, at the outset of geometrical discovery, Lines were not properly introduced to each other—or whether some mischief-making Point has been insinuating that one of til em went and intersected another when it was looking the other way—certain it is, that Lines will do almost <i>anything</i> you like to propose, rather than “meet” one another!) Mr.&nbsp;Walmsley assumes, as axiomatic, that when one Lino lies between two others (whatever “between” may mean), those two others lie on <i>opposite</i> sides of it. Now let Mr.&nbsp;Walmsley (or any other champion of his theory) draw three Lines diverging from a Point at equal angles (of 120° each), and thus dividing the infinite Plane into three equal Sectors. In each of these Sectors let him draw a branch of a Hyperbola, having the sides of the Sector as its Asymptotes. Now, each of these Hyperbolae lies (in a way) “between” the other two: and yet no two can be said to lie on opposite sides of the other one! “But,” says Mr.&nbsp;Walmsley (or the champion aforesaid) “these are <i>Curves</i>, not <i>straight Lines</i>!” Most true: but how are you to know that straight Lines will not behave just like Hyperbolæ, if only they are put far enough apart? Produce those three radiating Lines, that we began with, until each is a million miles long (paper, pen, and ink, provided regardless of expense): then, across their extremities, draw three Lines perpendicular to them. Why shouldn’t these three Lines (of course shunning a “meeting,” as all Lines do) perpetually face inwards, so that no one of them ever commits the discourtesy of turning its back upon either of the other two? “It cannot be,” say Messrs.&nbsp;Walmsley and Co.: “these Lines <i>must</i> intersect, if produced far enough.” What? In consequence of their relative situation? That relative situation being, for each pair of them, that they make with a certain transversal two interior angles together less than two right angles? In assuming <i>this</i>, I very much fear that Messrs.&nbsp;Walmsley and Co. are performing the not-wholly-unprecedented feat of assuming Euclid’s 12th Axiom!</p>

<h4>§ 6. The Outlook.</h4>

<p>In conclusion let me address myself to the young and eager explorer who, Alpine-staff in hand, and duly furnished with all the necessaries for his perilous quest—pick-axe, theodolite, paper-collars, Brown’s Sticking-Plaster, Jones’s Cough-Pills, and Robinson’s Insect-Powder, “the only known remedy for Phlebitis”—is preparing to sally forth, to do or die!</p>

<p>To him let me address myself, as being, perchance, an older and a more experienced traveller—one who has wandered much, and pondered long, and who can best describe himself in the words of a lady well-known in the literary world (I am glad to have this opportunity of recording them, as they have never been printed. They were written “for music,” for which purpose, I imagine, the amount of sense required is not excessive).</p>

<p>Poetry like this speaks for itself: vain were it to hope that any poor words of mine could serve to illuminate, or even elucidate, its almost ethereal beauty!</p>

<p>To what point of the compass, then, should this young and eager explorer be advised to direct his steps?</p>

<p>I think his <i>best</i> chance—and that only a slender one—is to find some elementary proof for my Axiom, or for one of the many Theorems which will serve the same purpose, a few of which I will enumerate. In the first place, <i>any</i> Polygon will do, and <i>any</i> ratio, between it and the out-lying Segment, so long as it is a <i>finite</i> ratio. What I want it for is to prove that there is <i>some</i> isosceles Triangle, with a definite vertical angle (i.&thinsp;e. some named fraction of a right angle), whose base is less than one of its sides. And that, again, is wanted in order to prove it possible to draw, on a given base, an isosceles Triangle, whose base-angles shall have some nameable value. And that, again, is wanted in order to prove that there is <i>some</i> finite minimum value for the sum of the angles of a Triangle. And that, again, is wanted in order to prove Prop.&nbsp;3, at <a href="#new-theory-parallels:prop-iii">p.&nbsp;19</a>. So, if any one of these propositions could be either assumed as an Axiom or granted as a Theorem, it would sufiice for the proof of Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32 and Co.</p>

<p>If, for example, you will grant me, as an Axiom, that there is <i>some</i> finite minimum value for the sum of the angles of a Triangle, no matter how small you make it, all is easy at once: grant me, for instance, that no Triangle can possibly have the sum of its angles less than a millionth of a right angle, and I am happy!</p>

<p>Finally, I am inclined to believe that, if ever Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32 is proved without a new Axiom, it will be by some new and ampler definition of <i>the Right Line</i>—some definition which shall connote that peculiar and mysterious property, which it must somehow possess, which causes Euc.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;32 to be true. Try <i>that</i> track, my gentle Reader! It is not much trodden as yet. And may success attend your search!</p>
