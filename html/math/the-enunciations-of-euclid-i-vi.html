<h2>The Enunciations of Euclid I–VI</h2>

<article>
<p class="subtitle">Together with Questions on the Definitions, Postulates, Axioms, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In this edition of the Enunciations, some emendations have been ventured on, two of which require special mention.</p>

<p>(1) The Corollary, usually appended to Proposition&nbsp;11 of Book&nbsp;I, is omitted, for the following reasons: that it is not Euclid’s—that the proof, usually given with it, is illogical—and that Euclid has tacitly assumed it in Proposition&nbsp;4.</p>

<p>(2) The Corollaries, usually appended to Proposition&nbsp;15, are here transferred to Proposition&nbsp;13, which is quite sufficient for their proof.</p>

<p>Besides these definite innovations, many of the Enunciations have been abridged, by the omission of superfluous words, and their language made more uniform in some instances where different words had been used to express the same thing. Capital initials have been used for the <i>chief</i> subjects having position, such as ‘Line,’ ‘Triangle,’ in order to distinguish them from the <i>subordinate</i> subjects having position, such as ‘centre of Circle,’ ‘diagonal of Parallelogram,’ and also from subjects having magnitude only, without definite position, such as the squares and rectangles treated of in Book&nbsp;II.</p>

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Cor.</span>&nbsp;2. If three straight Lines be proportionals, as the first is to the third, so is any rectilineal Figure upon the first, to a similar and similarly described rectilineal Figure upon the second.<br>
21. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Theor.</span> Rectilineal Figures, which are similar to the same rectilineal Figures, are also similar to one another.<br>
22. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Theor.</span> If four straight Lines be proportionals, the similar rectilineal Figures similarly described upon them are also proportionals; and if the similar rectilineal Figures similarly described upon four straight Lines be proportionals, those straight Lines are proportionals.<br>
23. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Theor.</span> Equiangular Parallelograms have to one another the ratio which is compounded of the ratios of their sides.<br>
24. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Theor.</span> The Parallelograms about the diameter of any Parallelogram are similar to the whole and to one another.<br>
25. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Probl.</span> To describe a rectilineal Figure similar to one, and equal to another, given rectilineal Figure.<br>
26. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Theor.</span> If two similar Parallelograms have a common angle and be similarly situated, they are about the same diameter.<br>
30. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Probl.</span> To divide a given straight Line in extreme and mean ratio.<br>
31. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Theor.</span> In right-angled Triangles, the rectilineal Figure described on the side opposite to the right angle, is equal to the similar and similarly described Figures on the sides containing it.<br>
32. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Theor.</span> If two Triangles, which have two sides of the one proportional to two sides of the other, be joined at one angle, so as to have their homologous sides parallel; the remaining sides are in a straight Line.<br>
33. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Theor.</span> In equal Circles, angles, whether at the centres or circumferences, have the same ratio which the circumferences have to one another; so also have the sectors.<br>
<i>B</i>. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Theor.</span> If the vertical angle of a Triangle be bisected by a straight Line, which likewise cuts the base; the rectangle contained by the sides of the Triangle is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the base, together with the square of the straight Line bisecting the angle.<br>
<i>C</i>. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Theor.</span> If from the vertical angle of a Triangle a straight Line be drawn perpendicular to the base; the rectangle contained by the sides of the Triangle is equal to the rectangle contained by the perpendicular and the diameter of the Circle described about the Triangle.<br>
<i>D</i>. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Theor.</span> The rectangle, contained by the diagonals of a quadrilateral Figure inscribed in a Circle, is equal to the rectangles contained by the opposite sides.
