<p><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-12">In Book&nbsp;I, Chapter&nbsp;II,</span> I have adopted a new definition of <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-13">‘Classification’,</span> which enables me to regard the whole Universe as a ‘Class,’ and thus to dispense with the very awkward phrase ‘a Set of Things.’</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-12">“In the first of these” in the second edition, “In the Chapter on ‘Classification’” in the third edition</aside>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-13">the Process</aside>

<p><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-14">In the Chapter on ‘Propositions of Existence’</span> I have adopted a new ‘normal form,’ in which the Class, whose existence is affirmed or denied, is regarded as the <i>Predicate</i>, instead of the <i>Subject</i>, of the Proposition, thus evading a very subtle difficulty which besets the other form. These subtle difficulties seem to lie at the root of every Tree of Knowledge, and they are <i>far</i> more hopeless to grapple with than any that occur in its higher branches. For example, the difficulties of the Forty-Seventh Proposition of Euclid are mere child’s play compared with the mental torture endured in the effort to think out the essential nature of a straight Line. And, in the present work, the difficulties of the “5 Liars” Problem, at <a href="content.html#symbolic-logic:five-liars">p.&nbsp;192</a>, are “trifles, light as air,” compared with the bewildering question <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-15">“What is a Thing?”</span></p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-14">“In the second” in the second edition</aside>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-15">Second and third edition differs from here, see below.</aside>

<p>In the Chapter on ‘Propositions of Relation’ I have inserted a new Section, containing the proof that a Proposition, beginning with “All,” is a <i>Double</i> Proposition (a fact that is quite independent of the arbitrary rule, laid down in the next Section, that such a Proposition is to be understood as implying the actual <i>existence</i> of its Subject). This proof was given, in the earlier editions, incidentally, in the course of the discussion of the Biliteral Diagram: but its <i>proper</i> place, in this treatise, is where I have now introduced it.</p>

<p>In the Sorites-Examples, I have made a good many verbal alterations, in order to evade a difficulty, which I fear will have perplexed some of the Readers of the first three Editions. Some of the Premisses were so worded that their Terms were not Specieses of the Univ. named in the Dictionary, but of a larger Class, of which the Univ. was only a portion. In all such cases, it was intended that the Reader should perceive that what was asserted of the larger Class was thereby asserted of the Univ., and should ignore, as superfluous, all that it asserted of its <i>other</i> portion. Thus, in Ex.&nbsp;15, the Univ. was stated to be “ducks in this village,” and the third Premiss was “Mrs.&nbsp;Bond has no gray ducks,” i.&thinsp;e. “No gray ducks are ducks belonging to Mrs.&nbsp;Bond.” Here the Terms are <i>not</i> Specieses of the Univ., but of the larger Class “ducks,” of which the Univ. is only a portion: and it was intended that the Reader should perceive that what is here asserted of “ducks” is thereby asserted of “ducks in this village.” and should treat this Premiss as if it were “Mrs.&nbsp;Bond has no gray ducks in this village,” and should ignore, as superfluous, what it asserts as to the <i>other</i> portion of the Class “ducks,” viz. “Mrs.&nbsp;Bond has no gray ducks <i>out of</i> this village”.</p>

<p>In the Appendix I have given a new version of the Problem of the “Five Liars.” My object, in doing so, is to escape the subtle and mysterious difficulties which beset all attempts at regarding a Proposition as being its own Subject, or a Set of Propositions as being Subjects for one another. It is certainly, a most bewildering and unsatisfactory theory: one cannot help feeling that there is a great lack of <i>substance</i> in all this shadowy host——that, as the procession of phantoms glides before us, there is not <i>one</i> that we can pounce upon, and say “<i>Here</i> is a Proposition that <i>must</i> be either true or false!”——that it is but a Barmecide Feast, to which we have been bidden——and that its prototype is to be found in that mythical island, whose inhabitants “earned a precarious living by taking in each others’ washing”! By simply translating “telling 2 Truths” into “taking <i>both</i> of 2 condiments (salt and mustard),” “telling 2 Lies” into “taking <i>neither</i> of them” and “telling a Truth and a Lie (order not specified)” into “taking only <i>one</i> condiment (it is not specified <i>which</i>),” I have escaped all those metaphysical puzzles, and have produced a Problem which, when translated into a Set of symbolized Premisses, furnishes the very same <i>Data</i> as were furnished by the Problem of the “Five Liars.”</p>

<p>The coined words, introduced in previous editions, such as “Eliminands” and “Retinends”, perhaps hardly need any apology: they were indispensable to my system: but the new plural, here used for the first time, viz. “Soriteses”, will, I fear, be condemned as “bad English”, unless I say a word in its defence. We have <i>three</i> singular nouns, in English, of plural <i>form</i>, “series”, “species”, and “Sorites”: in all three, the awkwardness, of using the same word for both singular and plural, must often have been felt: this has been remedied, in the case of “series” by coining the plural “serieses”, which has already found it way into the dictionaries: so I am no rash innovator, but am merely “following suit”, in using the new plural “Soriteses”.</p>

<p><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-16">In conclusion,</span> let me point out that even those, who are obliged to study <i>Formal</i> Logic, with a view to being able to answer Examination-Papers in that subject, will find the study of <i>Symbolic</i> Logic most helpful for this purpose, in throwing light upon many of the obscurities with which Formal Logic abounds, and in furnishing a delightfully easy method of <i>testing</i> the results arrived at by the cumbrous processes which Formal Logic enforces upon its votaries.</p>

<p>This is, I believe, the very first attempt (with the exception of my own little book, <i>The Game of Logic</i>, published in 1886, a very incomplete performance) that has been made to <i>popularise</i> this fascinating subject. It has cost me <i>years</i> of hard work: but if it should prove, as I hope it may, to be of <i>real</i> service to the young, and to be taken up, in High Schools and in private families, as a valuable addition to their stock of healthful mental recreations, such a result would more than repay ten times the labour that I have expended on it.</p>

<h4>Preface to the Second Edition</h4>
<p>…</p>

<p>Besides these alterations, I have corrected a number of misprints, some of which have been pointed out to me by friends——but none of my critics have been sharp-eyed enough to detect the splendid misprint at <a href="content.html#symbolic-logic:misprint">p.&nbsp;109</a>, where the following Trio of Propositions is proposed as a Syllogism:—</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>“A prudent man shuns hyænas;<br>
Anyhing but gold will fail to silence him.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>No banker fails to shun hyænas.”
</p></div>

<p>Kind friends have tried their best, with a really touching confidence in the infallibility of author and printer, to make sense of this hopeless jumble; and no suspicion has crossed their innocent minds (“For they suspected harm from none, They were themselves so good”) that the second Premiss hass wandered in here from the opposite page, and has displaced the lawful occupant, viz. “No banker is imprudent.”</p>

<p><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-18">Lastly, I have corrected one terrible mistake of my own, pointed out to me by a logical friend, who wrote that he had twice worked out the “5 Liars” Problem, and brought out the result “no solution.” And it was even so, I had to confess (of course in the appropriate attitude, prostrate, prone, and with ashes on my head). However, by transposing two words, I have set things right, and can now guarantee, to any Reader bold enough to attempt the Problem, that there <i>is</i> a solution, if only he can find it!</span></p>

<h3 id="symbolic-logic:introduction">Introduction</h3>
<header><p>Source: Symbolic Logic, second and fourth edition, first edition with minor differences</p></header>
<p class="subtitle">To Learners.</p>

<p>[N.B. Some remarks, addressed to <i>Teachers</i>, will be found in the Appendix, at <a href="content.html#symbolic-logic:appendix">p.&nbsp;165</a>.]
</p><hr class="medskip">

<p>The Learner, who wishes to try the question <i>fairly</i>, whether this little book does, or does not, supply the materials for a most interesting mental recreation, is <i>earnestly</i> advised to adopt the following Rules:—</p>

<p>(1) Begin at the <i>beginning</i>, and do not allow yourself to gratify a mere idle curiosity by dipping into the book, here and there. This would very likely lead to your throwing it aside, with the remark “This is <i>much</i> too hard for me!”, and thus losing the chance of adding a very <i>large</i> item to your stock of mental delights. This Rule (of not <i>dipping</i>) is very <i>desirable</i> with <i>other</i> kinds of books——such as novels, for instance, where you may easily spoil much of the enjoyment you would otherwise get from the story, by dipping into it further on, so that what the author meant to be a pleasant surprise comes to you as a matter of course. Some people, I know, make a practice of looking into Vol.&nbsp;III first, just to see how the story ends: and perhaps it <i>is</i> as well just to know that all ends <i>happily</i>——that the much-persecuted lovers <i>do</i> marry after all, that he is proved to be quite innocent of the murder, that the wicked cousin is completely foiled in his plot and gets the punishment he deserves, and that the rich uncle in India (<i>Qu.</i> Why in <i>India</i>? <i>Ans.</i> Because, somehow, uncles never <i>can</i> get rich anywhere else) dies at exactly the right moment——before taking the trouble to read Vol.&nbsp;I. This, I say, is <i>just</i> permissible with a <i>novel</i>, where Vol.&nbsp;III has a <i>meaning</i>, even for those who have not read the earlier part of the story; but, with a <i>scientific</i> book, it is sheer insanity: you will find the latter part <i>hopelessly</i> unintelligible, if you read it before reaching it in regular course.</p>

<p>(2) Don’t begin any fresh Chapter, or Section, until you are certain that you <i>thoroughly</i> understand the whole book <i>up to that point</i>, and that you have worked, correctly, most if not all of the examples which have been set. So long as you are conscious that all the land you have passed through is absolutely <i>conquered</i>, and that you are leaving no unsolved difficulties <i>behind</i> you, which will be sure to turn up again later on, your triumphal progress will be easy and delightful. Otherwise, you will find your state of puzzlement get worse and worse as you proceed, till you give up the whole thing in utter disgust.</p>

<p>(3) When you come to any passage you don’t understand, <i>read it again</i>: if you <i>still</i> don’t understand it, <i>read it again</i>: if you fail, even after <i>three</i> readings, very likely your brain is getting a little tired. In that case, put the book away, and take to other occupations, and next day, when you come to it fresh, you will very likely find that it is <i>quite</i> easy.</p>

<p>(4) If possible, find some genial friend, who will read the book along with you, and will talk over the difficulties with you. <i>Talking</i> is a wonderful smoother-over of difficulties. When <i>I</i> come upon anything——in Logic or in any other hard subject——that entirely puzzles me, I find it a capital plan to talk it over, <i>aloud</i>, even when I am all alone. One can explain things so <i>clearly</i> to one’s self! And then, you know, one is so <i>patient</i> with one’s self: one <i>never</i> gets irritated at one’s own stupidity!</p>

<p>If, dear Reader, you will faithfully observe these Rules, and so give my little book a really <i>fair</i> trial, I promise you, most confidently, that you will find Symbolic Logic to be one of the most, if not <i>the</i> most, fascinating of mental recreations! In this First Part, I have carefully avoided all difficulties which seemed to me to be beyond the grasp of an intelligent child of (say) twelve or fourteen years of age. I have myself taught most of its contents, <i>vivâ voce</i>, to <i>many</i> children, and have found them take a real intelligent interest in the subject. For those, who succeed in mastering Part&nbsp;I, and who begin, like Oliver, “asking for more,” I hope to provide, in Part&nbsp;II, some <i>tolerably</i> hard nuts to crack——nuts that will require all the nut-crackers they happen to possess!</p>

<p>Mental recreation is a thing that we all of us need for our mental health; and you may get much healthy enjoyment, no doubt, from Games, such as Back-gammon, Chess, and the new Game “Halma”. But, after all, when you have made yourself a first-rate player at any one of these Games, you have nothing real to <i>show</i> for it, as a <i>result!</i> You enjoyed the Game, and the victory, no doubt, <i>at the time</i>: but you have no <i>result</i> that you can treasure up and get real <i>good</i> out of. And, all the while, you have been leaving unexplored a perfect <i>mine</i> of wealth. Once master the machinery of Symbolic Logic, and you have a mental occupation always at hand, of absorbing interest, and one that will be of real <i>use</i> to you in <i>any</i> subject you may take up. It will give you clearness of thought——the ability to <i>see your way</i> through a puzzle——the habit of arranging your ideas in an orderly and get-at-able form——and, more valuable than all, the power to detect <i>fallacies</i>, and to tear to pieces the flimsy illogical arguments, which you will so continually encounter in books, in newspapers, in speeches, and even in sermons, and which so easily delude those who have never taken the trouble to master this fascinating Art. <i>Try it.</i> That is all I ask of you!</p>
