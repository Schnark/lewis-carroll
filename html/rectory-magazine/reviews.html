<p>According to our monthly custom, we sit down to review the works published during the last month, and sent for our approval. First in order stands a ponderous volume: “Natural Logic, by Professor Poddle:” which purports to be a variety of arguments drawn from observations of nature: these arguments are as ponderous as the book, and, to our weak intellect, perfectly incomprehensible: let us take the first sentence of his chapter on tadpoles, (p.&nbsp;46.) “<i>Upon this subject we could wish to deduce even more arguments than we are about: first, the reverberatory processes of Nature, as interwoven with the calumniations</i> (what calumniations?) <i>of astronomy persent a picture to the pleasing eye varied as the never-ending kaleidoscope</i> (we never saw one) <i>the probability of paralysation, is, we should say, greater than</i> (than what? do you suppose) <i>than the inferiority of other things as combined in the reciprocity of reaction.</i>” if you can understand this reader you are wiser than we. Next comes, “The Bandy-legged Butterfly, a tale for youth,” <i>we</i> should say for infants less than a month old, witness the following extract</p>

<p>“<i>My darling little Mousey-pousey, said the butterfly, good bye, lovey: ta ta pet: take care no naughty wolfey-pulfey hurts my little chicksey-picksey.</i>”</p>

<p>we suppose you’ve had <i>about</i> enough now.</p>

<p>The next is, “The child’s first question book” by a Lady: we consider the questions as rather foolish, and the answers as particularly so, but of course the author may judge for herself:</p>

<div class="verse"><p><span style="font-style: italic;">“Q. Who was Alexander the Great?”<br>
A. Please, ma’am, I don’t know, but I believe he was king of England.<br>
Q. Who was king of France?<br>
A. Louis the XI<sup>th</sup>.<br>
Q. Who was king of Rome?<br>
A. Servius Tullius.<br>
Q. Who was king of England?<br>
A. Henry the 3<sup>d</sup>.<br>
Q. Well then you see it couldn’t have been Alexander, now, what other country is there left?<br>
A. China.<br>
Q. Who was emperor of China.<br>
A. don’t know, Ma’am.<br>
Q. What’ll you do if you’re naughty?<br>
A. Hang.<br>
Q. Very well, then what conclusion do you draw from that?<br>
A. Please ’m, that I won’t do naughty.<br>
Q. No, I meant that Hang was Emperor of China, so Alexander couldn’t have been him; who was he?<br>
A. King of Macedon.”
</span></p></div>

<p>here eight questions are interposed between the question and answer: what the effect on the unhappy child would be, the reader shall judge.</p>
