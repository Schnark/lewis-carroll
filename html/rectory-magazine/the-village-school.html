<p>Methought I visited a village school: the mistress was reported to be mild and kind to the children, so that they all loved her, and I wished to see the fact with my own eyes, as I entered lessons were going on, “Sally Brown! don’t talk or you’ll catch it!” ”Please’m, I wasn’t talking!” “Don’t answer! go into the coal hole!” (pushes her in, and locks the door) “and,” (calling through the door) “and there you’ll stay till midnight.” “John Dobbs! don’t wink!” (gives him a violent blow on the back) “Don’t hurt that little boy,” I ventured to observe, “Hold your tongue, sir! it’s none of your business!” “Don’t move! Mary Jones!” “Please’m will you let out Sally? it was me that was talking.” “Oh! it was you, was it? well, take that,” (knocks her down,) “but I ca’n’t let <i>her</i> out now.” “Don’t look at me! Jack Burns!” (pushes him into the fire.) Methought I left the school.
