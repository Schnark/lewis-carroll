<p><a href="index-to-in-memoriam.html">This</a> was published in 1862, and is adapted to all editions in which the Poem consists of 130 sections. About the year 1870, a new section was introduced as No.&nbsp;39; for all subsequent editions, the Index may be used equally well, by simply adding “1” to every sectional number above “38.”</p>
