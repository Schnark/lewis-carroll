<h2>The Electric Pen</h2>

<p>The Electric Pen, with which I am now writing, seems to me to be quite the best thing yet invented for taking a number of copies of M.S., drawings, or maps.</p>

<p>The “pen” consists of a needle, in a holder like a pencil: the needle is worked in and out with enormous rapidity by electricity, &amp; projects just far enough to go through a thin sheet of paper. The result is that every line of the M.S. or drawing consists of a row of minute holes, almost close together. The paper thus prepared (which is called the “stencil”) is placed in a frame with blank paper underneath, &amp; an inked roller is passed backwards &amp; forwards over it: the ink is thus squeezed through the holes, &amp; the little dots, so formed, run together, forming continuous lines.</p>

<p>The writing of the stencil is rather slower than ordinary writing, but the copies are easily worked off at the rate of 2 a minute—probably, with practice, much faster. When as many copies have been worked off as are required at the time, the stencil may be cleaned with methylated spirits of wine, and laid aside for future use.</p>

<p>It is said that 3000 copies may be taken from one stencil.</p>

<p>This writing is not as good as it might be, but I have only had a few days’ practice. I have tried drawing as well, &amp; am delighted with the result.</p>

<p>The pen is a patented invention, &amp; may be had, with battery &amp;c., for 8 guineas, from the Electric Pen Company, 9.&nbsp;New Broad Street, City, London. </p><div class="signature"><p>C. L. Dodgson.<br>Ch&nbsp;Ch June 28/77</p></div>
