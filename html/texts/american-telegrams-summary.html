<p>The interview which has just taken place, between President L—— and the Confederate Commissioners, has resulted in a proposal from the President that three representatives from each of the contending parties shall meet to arrange conditions of peace. The following is said to be the Confederate “platform”:—
</p><hr class="smallskip">

<p>(1.) That the almost dictatorial power, held by General Grant, shall be largely curtailed, if not altogether abolished. It is understood that the President himself is so entirely under his influence as to be a free agent in name only: a state of things which, it is urged, cannot but be highly prejudical to the Union.</p>

<p>(2.) That the enormities perpetrated by General Butler shall meet with their due reward. The document from which we quote urges that “he has cost his country more in battels <i>(sic)</i> than any other known in our time,” and that “the interests of the few magnates, whose wealth he has augmented, cannot be suffered to outweigh those of the Commons he has so wantonly sacrificed.”</p>

<p>(3.) That the Treasury shall be placed under the control of Confederates and Federals alike: the Confederates urge that their party is “inadequately represented under the present administration,” and that the Secretary in particular “would be a blot in any conceivable system of government.”</p>

<p>(4.) That the forces at present in occupation of Confederate territory be withdrawn. “We can discuss no terms of peace,” say the Confederates, “with an armed foe. It is unworthy the dignity of a nation to be thus dictated to by the roar of canons <i>(sic)</i>.”
</p><hr class="smallskip">

<p>Other minor propositions may, it is understood, be presented to the Federals for consideration. One is, “that the services which General Early has rendered to his country be rewarded by advancement in the course of the ensuing summer.” This proposal, however, is said to be distasteful to the Federals, and the President himself is so opposed to the very idea of Early rising, that there is little hope of its being agreed on. Various charges are brought against this unpopular general, of which his abandonment of “Pillow,” (the Federals’ strongest fort) is one of the gravest.
</p><hr class="medskip">

<p>Gold 200, at which price it occasionally excites a brisk competition.</p>

<p>The difficulties of transit from place to place are enhanced by the insufficiency of public conveyances, and most of the travelling is done by means of private coaches. So much of the country, however, is still under martial law, that passes are not easy to obtain: in some instances they have been refused altogether.</p>

<p>The officers continue to send in long lists of sick and missing: much of this illness is supposed to be feigned for the sake of avoiding active service.</p>

<p>With a view to improving the condition of the lower classes, it is understood that collections will shortly be set on foot, under the authority of the President: this will probably have the effect of drawing attention to their number and wretchedness, but, beyond this, it is not anticipated that any great results will be derived from this measure.</p>
