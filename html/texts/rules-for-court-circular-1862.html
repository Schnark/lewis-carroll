<h3>I</h3>
<p>Cut for deal; highest is “first-hand”, lowest is dealer, gives 6 cards to each, 3 at a time, turning up 13th as “Lead”. First-hand plays a card, then dealer, and so on, as numbered in the diagram, till 6 have been played, when the trick is complete. No.&nbsp;5 is kept face down until No.&nbsp;6 has been played.</p>

<h3>II</h3>
<p>Whichever has, on his side of the trick, (Lead reckoning on each side) the best “Line” of 3 cards, (“Lines” being of 3 kinds, which rank as follows: Trio, e.&thinsp;g. 3 Kings or 3 Nines; Sequence, e.&thinsp;g. Nine of Hearts, Eight of Spades, Seven of Hearts; Suit, e.&thinsp;g. 3 Diamonds) wins it. It does not matter in what order the cards have been played, (e.&thinsp;g. if “Lead” be Five of Hearts, and one of the players play Ace of Spades, Seven of Clubs, Six of Diamonds, his side contains a sequence). Trio containing “Lead” ranks above Trio not containing it, and so of Sequence and Suit. “Lead” must not be reckoned as middle card of a Sequence. An Ace will form a Sequence with Two, Three, or with King, Queen.</p>

<h3>III</h3>
<p>If equal Lines be made, he who has played, among the cards forming his Line, the best card (cards ranking thus: Ace of Hearts, of Diamonds, of Clubs, of Spades, King of Hearts, etc.) wins the trick; if no Line be made, he who has played the best card wins it.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>
<p>When the trick is won by superiority of Line, the winner adds the value of his own Line, (reckoned thus: Trio 1, Sequence 2, Suit 3,) to that of the loser’s, if any, (reckoned thus: Trio 5, Sequence 3, Suit 1) and takes so many cards; when by superiority of cards, he takes one only. Lead for the next trick is then chosen from the cards left on the table, (by the winner, if both or neither have made a Line; otherwise by the loser), and the others laid aside. The loser is dealer for the next trick, and gives 3 cards to each.</p>

<h3>V</h3>
<p>When only 3 cards remain to be dealt, they are turned up, and each plays, either from the 3 cards in his hand, or from these 3, supplying its place from his own hand.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>
<p>When the pack is out, every trick (after four) counts 1; most cards, 2; most court-cards, (Aces reckoning as court-cards) 1. A Hit is 5, and two Hits make a Rubber.</p>
