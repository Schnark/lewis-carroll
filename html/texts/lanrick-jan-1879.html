<p class="subtitle">A Game for Two Players</p>
<div class="motto"><p><span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-1">“The muster-place be Lanrick mead.”</span></p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-1"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>The Lady of the Lake</i> by Sir Walter Scott</aside></div>

<p>The Game is played on a chess-board, each Player having 5 men; the other requisites are a die and dice-box, and something (such as a coin) to mark a square.</p>

<p>The interior of the board, excluding the border-squares, is regarded as containing 6 ‘rows’ and 6 ‘columns.’ It must be agreed which is the first row and first column.</p>

<p>1.—<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-2">The Players set the men in turn, on any border-squares they like.</span></p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-2">The men are set, alternately, on any border-squares.</aside>

<p>2.—The die is thrown twice, and a square marked accordingly, the first throw fixing the row, the second the column; the marked square, with the 8 surrounding squares, forms the first ‘rendezvous,’ into which the men are to be played.</p>

<p>3.—The men move like chess-queens; in playing for the first ‘rendezvous,’ each Player may move over 6 squares, either with one man, or dividing the move among several.</p>

<p>4.—When one Player has got all his men into the ‘rendezvous’ the other must remove from the board one of his men that has failed to get in; the die is then thrown for a new ‘rendezvous,’ for which each Player may move over as many squares as he had men in the last ‘rendezvous,’ and one more.</p>

<p>5.—If it be found that either Player has all his men already in the new ‘rendezvous,’ the die must be thrown again, till a ‘rendezvous’ is found where this is not the case.</p>

<p>6.—The Game ends when one Player has lost all his men.</p>
