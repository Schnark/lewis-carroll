<h2>Cautions to Readers</h2>
<p>Source: added to the advertisements of several books (e.&thinsp;g. in “Eight or Nine Wise Words” and “Sylvie and Bruno Concluded” with different punctuation), in some as “Caution to Readers” only the first paragraph, with variants like “Fräulein Ida Lackowitz, of 14, Lottumstrasse, Berlin” or “Miss Cato Schaap, of 40, West Zeedijk, Rotterdam”; here the variant from The Nursery “Alice”</p>
<p>Other version: <a href="../magazines/nineteenth-century.html">To the Editor of the Nineteenth Century</a></p></header>
<article>

<p>On August 1st, 1881, a story appeared in <i>Aunt Judy’s Magazine</i> No.&nbsp;184, entitled “The Land of Idleness, by <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lewis Carroll</span>.” This story was really written by a lady, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Fräulein Ida Lackowitz</span>. Acting on her behalf, Mr.&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Carroll</span> forwarded it to the Editor: and this led to the mistake of naming him as its author.</p>

<p>In October, 1887, the writer of an article on “Literature for the Little ones,” in <i>The Nineteenth Century</i>, stated that, in 1864, “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Tom Hood</span> was delighting the world with such works as <i>From Nowhere to the North Pole</i>. Between <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Tom Hood</span> and Mr.&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lewis Carroll</span> there is more than a suspicion of resemblance in some particulars. <i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i> narrowly escapes challenging a comparison with <i>From Nowhere to the North Pole</i>. The idea of both is so similar that Mr.&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Carroll</span> can hardly have been surprised if some people have believed he was inspired by <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Hood</span>.” The date 1864 is a mistake. <i>From Nowhere to the North Pole</i> was first published in <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-1">1874.</span></p>
