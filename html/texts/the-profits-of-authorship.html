<h2>The Profits of Authorship</h2>
<p>Source: probably printed 1884, only one paragraph available</p></header>
<article>

<p>The publisher contributes about as much as the bookseller in time and bodily labour, but in mental toil and trouble a great deal more. I speak with some personal knowledge of the matter, having myself, for some twenty years, inflicted on that most patient and painstaking firm, Messrs.&nbsp;Macmillan and Co., about as much wear and worry as ever publishers have lived through. The day when they undertake a book for me is a <i>dies nefastus</i> for them. From that day till the book is out—an interval of some two or three years on an average—there is no pause in <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-1">“the pelting of the pitiless storm”</span> of directions and questions on every conceivable detail. To say that every question gets a courteous and thoughtful reply—that they are still outside a lunatic asylum—and that they still regard me with some degree of charity—is to speak volumes in praise of their good temper and of their health, bodily and mental. I think the publisher’s claim on the profits is on the whole stronger than the bookseller’s.</p>

<footer><p>In connection with this, advertisements for Carroll’s books contained the following note (here from <i>A Tangled Tale</i>):</p>

<p>N.B. In selling the above-mentioned books to the Trade, Messrs. Macmillan and Co. will abate 2<i>d</i>. in the shilling (no odd copies), and allow 5 per cent. discount for payment within six months, and 10 per cent. for cash. In selling them to the Public (for cash only) they will allow 10 per cent. discount.
