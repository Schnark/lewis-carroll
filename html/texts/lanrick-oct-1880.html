<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-1"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>The Lady of the Lake</i> by Sir Walter Scott</aside></div>

<p>The game is played on a chess-board, each Player having five men.</p>

<p>1. One Player sets all the men on any border-squares he likes.</p>

<p>2. The other then selects a square (not a border-square) and lays on it something (such as a coin) to mark it. This, with the eight surrounding squares, forms the first ‘rendenzvous’, into which the men are to be played; the one, who did not select the ‘rendenzvous’, having the first move.</p>

<p>3. Each may move as many squares (or any lesser number) as he has men on the board, either with one man, or dividing the move among several. He must move each man like a rook, or else like a bishop.</p>

<p>4. When a player has all his men in the ‘rendenzvous’, he removes from the board one of the ‘wanderers’ (i.&thinsp;e. the men who have not got in), and plays the others to border-squares.</p>

<p>5. The other then selects a new ‘rendenzvous’ (which must be clear of the old one, and also, if possible, empty), and the game proceeds, as in Rule&nbsp;2, until one of the Players has lost all his men.</p>
