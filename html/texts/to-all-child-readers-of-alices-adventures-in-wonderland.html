<p>Dear Children,</p>

<p>At Christmas time a few grave words are not quite out of place, I hope, even at the end of a book of nonsense—and I want to take this opportunity of thanking the thousands of children who have read “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” for the kindly interest they have taken in my little dream-child.</p>

<p>The thought of the many English firesides where happy faces have smiled her a welcome, and of the many English children to whom she has brought an hour of (I trust) innocent amusement, is one of the brightest and pleasantest thoughts of my life. I have a host of young friends already, whose names and faces I know—but I cannot help feeling as if, through “Alice’s Adventures,” I had made friends with many many other dear children, whose faces I shall never see.</p>

<p>To all my little friends, known and unknown, I wish with all my heart, “A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.” May God bless you, dear children, and make each Christmas-tide, as it comes round to you, more bright and beautiful than the last—bright with the presence of that unseen Friend, Who once on earth blessed little children—and beautiful with memories of a loving life, which has sought and found that truest kind of happiness, the only kind that is really worth the having, the happiness of making others happy too!</p>

<p>Your affectionate Friend,
