<h3 id="representative:little">Lecture 1st. “On the Uses of Little Men”</h3>

<p>“The world is made of little men.” ’Tis a little saying, but how true! Go where you will, you meet them: they are the majority of the people, the nobility, the army, the orators. Can an army exist without private soldiers? no more than a house without bricks. For every great man, there are 10,000 little men: aye, and there is work for them, which no great man would do. Do not little men build our houses and ships, till our land, and supply our various wants? Ask the great Alexander to make a pudding. Faugh! But the pudding <i>must</i> be made. A most important class truely! and all-worthy of a representative. How profoundly little was the saying of the countryman<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> when the dumplings came to table. <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-1">“them’s the jockeys for my money!”</span></p>

<p>The great men round him laughed at it; <i>we</i> know it’s value. Look at the Times: “the smallest terrier in England, lowest price £25” Little! little! is still the cry. Draw up the curtain! Enter, little man!</p>

<h3 id="representative:cuffey">Lecture 2nd. “Cuffey, or the Chartist”</h3>

</figure>

<p>Chartism, or democracy, has always had it’s little men. It is intrinsically a little ambition which inspires it’s followers: they would have all men level: natural representative is Cuffey.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> The little Cuffey was born in humble life: so are all little men: it is a remarkable and peculiar trait <i>of</i> little men: in body<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup> he was little, in mind, less: his wife took in washing: he gloried in making the fact public: could anything be littler? One fact shews the profound littleness of this man: he declared in public, “I gave my wife <i>leave</i> to take in washing.” Leave! no doubt his wife boxed his ears for it afterwards: it was a fitting reward for such littleness. His little seditious attempts had little effect: he and his littleness were transported. Ah! little, <i>little</i> man!</p>

<h3 id="representative:jack-sprat">Lecture 3d. “Jack Sprat, or the Epicure”</h3>

</figure>

<p>We have the highest authority for stating the fact that Jack, or John Sprat<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup> could eat no fat. The conviction bursts upon us with such a blaze of evidence, that room for doubt there is none. Now, even if we grant that he had a “little” appetite, and so was not sufficiently hungry to desire to eat fat—even granting this, I say, and the admission, instead of lessening, would but strengthen my argument for the littleness of the man—still how can anyone pretend to set aside or step over the fact that he permitted his wife to refuse lean? Yes! it is so stated: <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-2">“his wife would eat no lean”</span>: not a word his said of his pulling a stop to her whims: no, he submitted with true littleness of mind. All epicures are little, and he is but a common specimen of the class.</p>
