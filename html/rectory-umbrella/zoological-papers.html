<img src="../../images/rectory-umbrella/zoological-pixies.jpg" width="561" height="109" alt="Two creatures without wings flying like they are swimming.">
</figure>

<p>The origin of this curious race of creatures is not at present known: the best description we can collect of them is this, that they are a species of fairies about two feet high,<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> of small and graceful figure; they are covered with a dark reddish sort of fur; the general expression of their faces is sweetness and good humour; the former quality is probably the reason why foxes are so fond of eating them. From Coleridge we learn the following additional facts; that they have <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-1">“filmy pinions,” something like dragon flies’ wings, that they “sip the furze-flower’s fragrant dew,” (that, however, could only be for breakfast, as it would dry up before dinner time), and they are wont to “flash their faery feet in gamesome prank,”</span> or, in more common language, “to dance the polka<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> like winking.”</p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-1"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>Elfin music. Songs of the Pixies</i> by Arthur Edward Waite</aside>

<p>From an old English legend<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> which, as it is familiar to most of our readers, we need not here repeat, we learn that they have a strong affection for raw turnips, decidedly a more vulgar sort of food than “fragrant dew”; and from their using churns and kettles we conjecture that they are not unacquainted with tea, milk, butter &amp;cc. They are tolerably good architects, though their houses must unavoidably have something the appearance of large dog kennels, and they go to market occasionally, though from what source they get the money<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup> for this purpose, has hitherto remained an unexplained mystery. This is all the information we have been able to collect on this interesting subject. In our next paper we propose to discuss the natural history of “the Lory.”</p>

<h3 id="zoological:lory">No.&nbsp;2. The Lory</h3>
<p>This creature is, we believe, a species of parrot: Southey informs us that it is a <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-2">“bird of gorgeous plumery,”</span><sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup> and it is our private opinion that there never existed more than one, whose history as far as practicable we will now lay before our readers.</p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-2"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>Mount Meru</i> by Robert Southey</aside>

<p>The time and place of the Lory’s birth is uncertain: the egg from which it was hatched was most probably, to judge from the colour of the bird, one of those magnificent Easter eggs<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup> which our readers have doubtless often seen; the experiment of hatching an Easter egg is at any rate worth trying.</p>

<p>That it came into the possession of Cambeo, or Cupid, at a very early age, is evident from its extreme docility, as we find him using it, by all accounts without saddle or bridle,<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup> for a kind of shooting pony in Southey’s poem of <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-3">“the Curse of Kehama.”</span> We need not relate its history therein contained, as our readers may see it themselves, so we proceed at once to the conclusion. When Kehama had done for the rest of the gods, and had been thereupon scorched by the combined influence of Seeva’s angry eye, and the Amreeta drink, which must have been something like fluid curry powder, it is more than probable that in the universal smash which then occurred, Cambeo’s affairs among others were wound up. His goods and chattels were then most likely put up to auction, the Lory included, which we have reason to believe was knocked down to the Glendoveer,<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup> in whose possession it remained for the rest of its life.</p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-3"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>The Curse of Kehama</i> by Robert Southey</aside>

<p>After its death we conjecture that the Glendoveer, unwilling to lose sight of its “plumery,” had it stuffed, and some years afterwards, at the suggestion of Kailyal, presented it to the Museum at York, where it may now be seen, by the inquiring reader, admittance one shilling. Having thus stated all we know, and a good deal we don’t know, on this interesting subject, we must conclude: our next subject will probably be “Fishs.”</p>

<h3 id="zoological:fishs">No.&nbsp;3. Fishs</h3>
<figure>

<img src="../../images/rectory-umbrella/zoological-fishs-2.jpg" width="197" height="83" alt="One fish, the open mouth shows sharp teeth.">
</figure>

<p>The facts we have collected about this strange race of creatures are drawn partly from observation, partly from the works of a German author, whose name has not been given to the world. We believe that they<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup> are only to be found in Germany: our author tells us they have “ordinarely<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup> angles<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup> at them,” by which they “can be fanged, and heaved out of the water.” The specimens which fell under our observation had <i>not</i> angles, as will shortly be seen, and therefore this sketch<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup> is founded on mere conjecture.</p>

<figure style="max-width:10em;">
<img src="../../images/rectory-umbrella/zoological-fishs-3.jpg" width="387" height="311" alt="A crane with a rope in its beak, the other end is knotted round a fish.">
</figure>

<p>What the “fanging” consists of we cannot exactly say: if it is anything like a dog “fanging” a bone, it is certainly a strange mode of capture, but perhaps the writer refers to otters. The “heaving out of the water” we have likewise attempted to pourtray, though here again fancy is our only guide. The reader probably will aks, “why put a <i>Crane</i> into the picture?” our answer is “the only “heaving” we ever saw done was by means of a Crane.”</p>

<p>This part of the subject however will be more properly treated of in the next paper.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-13">13</a></sup> Another fact our author gives us is that “they will very readily swim<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup> after the pleasing directions of the staff”: this is easier to understand, as the simplest reader at once perceives that the only “staff” answering to this description is a stick of barley sugar.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-15">15</a></sup></p>

<figure class="float-right" style="max-width:7em;">
<img src="../../images/rectory-umbrella/zoological-fishs-4.jpg" width="217" height="64" alt="A fish with round body.">
</figure>

<p>We will now attempt to describe the “fishs” which we examined. Skin hard and metallic; colour brilliant, and of many hues; body hollow;<span id="fishs:hollow"></span> (surprising as this fact may appear, it is <i>perfectly true</i>); eyes large and meaningless; fins fixed, and perfectly useless. They are wonderfully light, and have a sort of beak or snout of a metallic substance: as this is solid, and they have no other mouth, their hollowness is thus easily accounted for. The colour is sticky and comes off on the fingers, and they can swim back downwards just as easily as in the usual way. All these facts prove that they must not on any account be confounded with the English “fishes,” which the similarity of names might at first lead us to do. They are a peculiar race of animals,<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup> and must be treated as such. Our next subject<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-17">17</a></sup> will be “The One-winged Dove.”</p>

<h3 id="zoological:dove">No.&nbsp;4: The One-Winged Dove</h3>

<figure>
<img src="../../images/rectory-umbrella/zoological-dove.jpg" width="636" height="120" alt="The One-winged Dove and two fishs">
</figure>

<p>All the information we can collect on this subject is taken from an advertisement in the Times, July 2, 1850, the rest is conjecture.</p>

<p>To begin with the advertisement. <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-4">“The One-winged Dove must Die, unless the Crane returns to be a shield against her enemies.”</span> From this we draw the following facts. (1). It is a dove with one wing. (2.) The Crane is it’s friend. (3.) It has enemies who wish it’s death. (4.) The Crane alone can resist these enemies. (5.) The Crane has left it. (6.) (from the mere fact of the advertisement being sent to the Times) The Dove can write. (7.) (from the same fact) The Crane can read. (8.) (do.) The Dove has more than 12s in the world. (9.) (do.) The Crane takes in the Times.</p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-4"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>Agony</i> column in the <i>Times</i>, July 15, 18, 22, 25, 1850, and more occurences in other papers</aside>

<p>So that here is at any rate a reasonable foundation for conjecture. You are not so clever<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-18">18</a></sup> as we are, Reader, so it will not be surprising if you have not yet discovered that facts (1) and (6) are connected together,<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-19">19</a></sup> and explain each other. Have you now? confess! There is another discovery which has probably hitherto escaped your notice, namely, that fact (2) and (3) are similarly connected.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-20">20</a></sup> So now to begin.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-21">21</a></sup></p>

<p>The Crane and the Dove are friends.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-22">22</a></sup> This is natural, as they are both birds: it seems hardly necessary to speculate on the origin of this friendship, perhaps their natural talents,<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-23">23</a></sup> namely, reading and writing, first led to it.</p>

<p>The Dove has but one wing,<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-24">24</a></sup> that is, it has lost the other. This is <i>un</i>natural, but we hope to account for it soon. It is evidently this misfortune which prevents it’s escaping from it’s enemies,<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-25">25</a></sup> and this gives us the first clue as to the nature of those enemies. Clearly they cannot be birds; two wings would be no protection against <i>them</i>: neither can they be beasts,<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-26">26</a></sup> against whom the Crane could be no protection<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-27">27</a></sup>: they are as clearly not English; the Crane is not wild in England:<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-28">28</a></sup> insects are too contemptible a foe. There is only one thing left: come, Reader! you shall have the credit of guessing! that’s right! “Fishs.” Not “fishes,” mind! <i>that</i> is an English name, but “fishs.”</p>

<p>And we are here met by a startling, a thrilling confirmation in the fact that a <i>Crane</i> is to be the shield against these enemies. Turn back, Reader, to the paper<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-29">29</a></sup> on “Fishs”: what is employed to “fang” those “fishs”? to “heave them out of the water,” and so to destroy them? is it not a Crane? This conclusion, then, cannot be disputed.</p>

<p>“Fishs,” then, are the Dove’s enemies. But why? what occasioned this enemity? everything must have a reason. Be patient, Reader. The Dove, we know, is talented<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-30">30</a></sup>: it therefore probably writes in <span id="dove:punch"></span>Punch: “fishs” have “angles”: “angle” is a word of two meanings. What so natural, then, as that it should write jokes on “fishs”? This would of course enrage the said “fishs,” and enmity would thereby arise. Is not this clear enough? We know also that “fishs” were long ere this enemies to the Crane, because of it’s habit of “fanging” them, and “heaving them out of the water.” The Crane then was, of all birds, the most proper friend for the Dove to appeal to.</p>

<p>“But,” say you, “how could “fishs” kill the Dove?” Oh most stupid and ignorant Reader! have not “fishs” got “angles”? are not “angles” sharp and jagged? How easy then with them to kill so tender<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-31">31</a></sup> a creature as a One-Winged Dove! And now for the grand question, “how did the Dove lose it’s wing?” and the mysterious connection between facts (1) and (6).<span id="dove:connection"></span> Reader! you shall guess again. The Dove writes in Punch<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-32">32</a></sup>: pens are used in writing: pens are procured from feathers<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-33">33</a></sup>: feathers from—yes! you’re right! “it uses it’s own feathers.” Perhaps you are not aware that Punch has been in existence nine years, so that if the Dove was a contributor from the first, the loss of one whole wing is thus easily accounted for. You will surely allow that thus far at least, we build our conjectures entirely on fact?</p>

<p>Is it likely that the Crane should have left the Dove<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-34">34</a></sup> in it’s present defenceless condition? Certainly not.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-35">35</a></sup> We may safely conclude that it left it while still able to defend itself. When was that? Calculate for yourself, Reader. Punch comes out once a week: probably the Dove writes one article in each number,<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-36">36</a></sup> that is, uses one pen or feather each week: thirteen feathers would probably<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-37">37</a></sup> make a wing large enough to fly with: it has evidently <i>none</i> now: thirteen weeks from the date of it’s first advertisement brings us to April 7: can’t you guess now? Well then, we must tell you. On April 9th a great <i>Protectionist</i> Meeting took place in London. Still stupid? Reader! you are wonderfully slow of comprehension! does not the Crane <i>protect</i> the Dove? what other motive <i>could</i> it have then for going up to London on the 9th but attending that meeting?</p>

<p>And now what conclusion are we to draw from the facts that the Dove has more than 12s,<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-38">38</a></sup> and that the Crane takes in the Times<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-39">39</a></sup>? We may as well just mention that 12s is the usual price<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-40">40</a></sup> for inserting such an advertisement in a newspaper. Simply this. The Dove is rich<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-41">41</a></sup>: therefore it pays the Crane for defending it, and this accounts for the Crane’s taking in the Times: where else could it get the money to do so? “But where,” you ask, “where does the Dove get <i>it’s</i> <span id="dove:money"></span>money?” That, gentle Reader, is it’s own affair. We know that it <i>has</i> money because otherwise it could not advertise.</p>

<p>One question yet remains unanswered; “where does the Dove live?” that is easily disposed of. “Fishs” are only found in Germany. <i>There</i> then the Dove lives. As evidently the Crane is in England, else why advertise<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-42">42</a></sup> for it in an English paper? “But it left Germany thirteen weeks ago!” you say, “cruel Crane! why does it not return?” Reader, we echo the question, and we tremble as we do so.</p>

<p>The life of a Crane in England is no safe or easy life: even at this moment probably the Crane is either dead or in a cage. This alone can account for it’s silence. <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-5">Alas! poor Dove<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-43">43</a></sup>!</span> what will you do? you state yourself that you “must die.” We fear it is only too true.</p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-5"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>Hamlet</i> by William Shakespeare</aside>

<p>We are aware that one objection can be brought against this argument, namely, that no one remembers seeing any jokes in Punch about “Fishs.” This however is no real argument, as the statement at best is negative, and besides, how faithless a thing is memory! Will you, oh Reader, be certain you can remember every joke Punch has published for nine years?</p>

<p>We have dwelt thus long and earnestly on this subject, as knowing it’s difficulty and importance: still we hope we have established <i>some</i> facts, cleared up <i>some</i> doubts, solved <i>some</i> difficulties. At all events we have done our best: we cannot name any subject for our next paper, nor are we at all sure there will be another at all, so at any rate for the present, good Reader, farewell!</p>
