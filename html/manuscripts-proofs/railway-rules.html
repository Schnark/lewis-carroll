<p>Station master must mind his station, and supply refreshments: he can put anyone who behaves badly to prison, while a train goes round the garden: he must ring for the passengers to take their seats, then count 20 slowly, then ring again for the train to start. The L one shall be a surgeon, the wounded must be brought there gratis by the next train going that way and cured gratis. There shall be a place at the L station for lost luggage. If there is anyone to go, a flag is to be hoisted.</p>

<p>Passengers may not go on the line on any pretence: parents responsible for their children: may not get in or out of the train when moving: the money is divided equally among all except drivers: the parents take their childrens’: any one without money works at one of the stations.</p>
