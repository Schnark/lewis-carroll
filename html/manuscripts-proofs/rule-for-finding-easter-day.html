<h2>Rule for Finding Easter-Day for Any Date till <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;2499</h2>
<p>Source: unpublished proof probably written 1892 (or 1897), meant for <i>Original Games and Puzzles</i>, Book III. Other Mental Recreations, Chapter VII; several errors and inconsistencies have been silently corrected, some from Carroll’s manuscript corrections</p></header>
<article>

<h3>1. Introductory</h3>

<p>The <i>principle</i> of this Rule is due to Gauss, whose proof of it is given in Zach’s <i>Monatliche Correspondenz</i>, August 1800, Vol.&nbsp;II, pp.&nbsp;221–230, whence it is quoted by Mr. W. W. Rouse Ball, in his <i>Mathematical Recreations</i>, published by Macmillan and Co. The only <i>original</i> feature, in my version of the Rule, consists in its greater simplicity. By my method the result can be calculated mentally, without much difficulty, in about half-a-minute: by the method of Gauss, it would certainly require a much longer time, and also much greater powers of mental calculation.</p>

<p>Before learning the Rule itself, the Reader should make himself expert in certain necessary Arithmetical Processes, as here specified.</p>

<h3>2. Some Necessary Arithmetical Processes</h3>

<h4>(1) To add 15 to a given No.</h4>

<p>Go up in two steps—10 and 5.</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Thus, if the given No. be 187, say “197, 202.”]
</p></div>

<h4>(2) To find the Remainder that would be left if a given No. were divided by 4</h4>

<p>Divide the last 2 digits.</p>

<h4>(3) To find the Remainder that would be left if a given No. were divided by 7</h4>

<p>Name the successive <i>dividends</i>. This is all the mental <i>soliloquy</i> required. The <i>remainder</i> in each dividend (which of course serves as the tens-digit of the next dividend) is easily seen by mere inspection.</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Thus, if the given No. be 4325, say “43; 12; 55; 6.”]
</p></div>

<p>It will be well to <i>cast out sevens</i>, whenever that can conveniently be done.</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Hence, if a dividend be a multiple of 7, say “goes out”, and ignore it.</p>

<p>Thus, if the given No. be 4225, say “42 goes out; 25; 4.” If it be 4769, say “47; 56 goes out; 9; 2.”]
</p></div>

<h4>(4) To find the Remainder that would be left if a given No. were divided by 19</h4>

<p>If the given No. be not greater than 30, the Remainder is easily seen by mere inspection.</p>

<p>If it be greater than 30, take enough of its digits to make a number greater than “1.” If this number be even, halve it, and add the next digit; if odd, take its lesser half, and add the next digit, with a “1” prefixed. Imagine the result to be substituted for the digits so used, and proceed as before.</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Thus, if the given No. be 88, say “4 and 8 is 12.”</p>

<p>If it be 98, say ”4 and 18 is 22; 3.”</p>

<p>If it be 147, say “7 and 7 is 14.”</p>

<p>If it be 157, say ”7 and 17 is 24; 5.”</p>

<p>If it be 687, say “3 and 8 is 11; 5 and 17 is 22; 3.”]
</p></div>

<p>Cast out nineteens, whenever you can.</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Thus, if the given No. be 1992, ignore the first 2 digits, and say “4 and 12 is 16.”</p>

<p>If it be 5749, say “2 and 17 is 19, which goes out; 2 and 9 is 11.”</p>

<p>If it be 998, say “4 and 19 gives 4; 2 and 8 is 10.”</p>

<p>If it be 7994, say “3 and 19 gives 3; 1 and 19 gives 1; 14.”]
</p></div>

<p>If you have to add 18, or 17, &amp;c, call it “19 <i>minus</i> 1,” or “19 <i>minus</i> 2,” &amp;c, and ignore the “19.”</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Thus, if given No. be 789, say “3 and <i>minus</i> 1 is 2; 1 and 9 is 10.”</p>

<p>If it be 967, say “4 and <i>minus</i> 3 is 1; 17.”]
</p></div>

<p>But this method must not be used if the number, to which the 18, &amp;c, is to be added, is <i>less than the number which would be deducted</i>,</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Thus, if the given No. be 567, do <i>not</i> say “2 <i>minus</i> 3,” but say “2 and 16 is 18; 9 and 7 is 16.”]
</p></div>

<h4>(5) To multiply a given No., of 2 digits, whose sum is no greater than 9, by 11</h4>

<p>Put the sum of the digits between them.</p>

<h4>(6) To find the Defect of a given No. from the lowest multiple of 30 which contains it</h4>

<p>The given No. must be either (<i>α</i>) a multiple of 30, or (<i>β</i>) not more than 10 off the lowest multiple of 30 which contains it, or (<i>γ</i>) more than 10 off it.</p>

<p>In case (<i>α</i>), or (<i>β</i>), the Defect may be seen by mere inspection.</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Thus, if the given No. be 180, say “Defect is 0.” If it be 208, say “Defect is 2.”]
</p></div>

<p>In case (<i>γ</i>), take the <i>Excess</i> of the given No. <i>above</i> the next <i>lower</i> Multiple of 30, and deduct from 30.</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Thus, if the given No. be 189, say “9 above; Defect is 21.” If it be 192, say “12 above; Defect is 18.”]
</p></div>

<h3>3. Rule for Finding Easter-Day for Any Given Date till <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;2499</h3>

<p>The phrase “4-Rem,” used with reference to a certain No., means “the Remainder that would be left it the No. were divided by 4;” and similarly for the phrases “7-Rem” and “19-Rem.”</p>

<p>Three Nos. are required, two of which are known, by memory, as soon as the Date is named; the third has to be calculated. Let us call them <var>a</var>, <var>h</var>, <var>k</var>.</p>

<p>The Rule may conveniently be divided into three parts, as follows:—</p>

<p>(1) Name the given Date, and then recall, by memory, the values of <var>a</var> and <var>h</var> belonging to it. For Old Style the values are always 15 and 6. For New Style, they are given in the following Table:—</p>

<div class="center"><table class="r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 r7 r8 r9 r10 r11">
<tr style="border-bottom: solid thin;"><td>No. of hundreds in Date</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>18</td><td>19</td><td>20</td><td>21</td><td>22</td><td>23</td><td style="text-align: right;">24</td></tr>
<tr style="border-top: solid thin;"><td>Value of <var>a</var> <span class="after-dotfill"></span></td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td style="text-align: right;">5</td></tr>
<tr style="border-bottom: solid thin;"><td><span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span> ” <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span> <var>h</var> <span class="after-dotfill"></span></td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td style="text-align: right;">1</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Picture this in your mind’s eye, and say over the Nos. of hundreds, till you reach the given one; then name the values of <var>a</var> and <var>h</var> in each column.</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Thus if the given Date be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1582” (which, for our present purpose is O.S., as N.S. did not begin till October), say “1582; Old Style; <var>a</var> and <var>h</var> are 15 and 6.”</p>

<p>If it be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1583, N.S.,” say “1583; New Style; 15; <var>a</var> and <var>h</var> are 8 and 2.”</p>

<p>If it be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1583, O.S.,” say “1583; Old Style; <var>a</var> and <var>h</var> are 15 and 6.”</p>

<p>If it be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1948, N.S.,” say “1948; New Style; 15, 16, 17, 18, 19; <var>a</var> and <var>h</var> are 6 and 5.”]
</p></div>

<p>(2) Again name the given Date, and find its 4-Rem and its 7-Rem: then take “4-Rem <i>plus</i> twice 7-Rem”; double; add <var>h</var>; the 7-Rem of this result is <var>k</var>.</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Thus, if the given Date be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1582,” say “1582; 4-Rem; 82; 2; 7-Rem; 15, 18, 42; 0; 2 and 0 is 2; 4; and 6 is 10; <var>k</var> is 3.”</p>

<p>If it be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1583, N.S.,” say “1583; 4-Rem; 83; 3; 7-Rem; 15, 18, 43; 1; 3 and 2 is 5; 10; and 2 is 12; <var>k</var> is 5.”</p>

<p>If it be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1583, O.S.,” say “1583; 4-Rem; 83; 3; 7-Rem; 15, 18, 43; 1; 3 and 2 is 5; 10; and 6 is 16; <var>k</var> is 2.”</p>

<p>If it be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1948, N.S.,” say “1948; 4-Rem; 48; 0; 7-Rem; 19, 54, 58; 2; 0 and 4 is 4; 8; and 5 is 13; <var>k</var> is 6.”</p>

<p>If it be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1948, O.S.,” say “1948; 4-Rem; 48; 0; 7-Rem; 19, 54, 58; 2; 0 and 4 is 4; 8; and 6 is 14; <var>k</var> is 0.”]
</p></div>

<p>(3) Name <var>a</var> and <var>k</var>; name given Date; find its 19-Rem; multiply by 11; add <var>a</var>; find Defect of this from lowest multiple of 30 which contains it; find highest multiple of 7 contained in Defect, and add <var>k</var>. If this result falls short of Defect, then either deduct 2 and call it “April,” or (if this cannot be done) add 29 and call it “March.” If the result does <i>not</i> fall short of Defect, then either deduct 9 and call it “April,” or (if this cannot be done) add 22 and call it “March.”</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Thus, if the given Date be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1582,” and if <var>a</var> and <var>k</var> be known to be 15 and 3, say “<var>a</var> and <var>k</var> are 15 and 3; 1582; 7 and <i>minus</i> 1 is 6; 3 and 2 is 5; 55; and 15 is 65, 70; 10 above; Defect is 20; 14 and 3 is 17, which falls short; deduct 2; April 15.”</p>

<p>If it be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1583, N.S.,” and if <var>a</var> and <var>k</var> be known to be 8 and 5, say “<var>a</var> and <var>k</var> are 8 and 5; 1583; 7 and <i>minus</i> 1 is 6; 3 and 3 is 6; 66; and 8 is 74; 14 above; Defect is 16; 14 and 5 is 19, which does <i>not</i> fall short; deduct 9; April 10.”</p>

<p>If it be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1583, O.S.,” and if <var>a</var> and <var>k</var> be known to be 15 and 2, say “<var>a</var> and <var>k</var> are 15 and 2; 1583; 7 and <i>minus</i> 1 is 6; 3 and 3 is 6; 66; and 15 is 76, 81; Defect is 9; 7 and 2 is 9, which does <i>not</i> fall short; add 22; March 31.”</p>

<p>If it be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1948, N.S.,” and if <var>a</var> and <var>k</var> be known to be 6 and 6, say “<var>a</var> and <var>k</var> are 6 and 6; 1948; 19 goes out, 2 and 8 is 10; 110; and 6 is 116; Defect is 4; 0 and 6 is 6, which does <i>not</i> fall short; add 22; March 28.”</p>

<p>If it be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1948, O.S.,” and if <var>a</var> and <var>k</var> be known to be 15 and 0, say “<var>a</var> and <var>k</var> are 15 and 0; 1948; 19 goes out, 2 and 8 is 10; 110; and 15 is 120, 125; 5 above; Defect is 25; 21 and 0 is 21, which falls short; deduct 2; April 19.”]
</p></div>

<h3>4. Aids to Memory, &amp;c</h3>

<h4>(1) To remember the given Date, while working the Rule</h4>

<p>If you are handy at making <a href="../texts/memoria-technica-1877.html"><i>Memoria Technica</i></a> words, you will find <i>that</i> a very useful method. Otherwise, you had better <i>write it down</i>, as it is certainly a trial, for the temper, to find, after carefully working out Easter-Day, that the Date, for which you have calculated it, has vanished from your memory!</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[The Dates, worked out as examples in the next Section, may conveniently be remembered by the following words:—<br>
853 “kilt”; 1654 “box-leaf”; 1881 “choke boy.”]
</p></div>

<h4>(2) To remember the <math><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow></math>-Table</h4>

<p>The first six columns are the most useful. In them, note that the values for <var>a</var> are “2 eights, 2 sevens, 2 sixes,” and that, in the first 3 columns, <var>a</var> and <var>h</var> add up to 10, and in the other 3 to 11.</p>

<p>In the last 4 columns, the values for <var>a</var> and <var>h</var> are given in the third and fourth lines of the following <i>Memoria Technica</i> stanza:—</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>List my song to!<br>
’Tis as wrong to<br>
Save a flea<br>
As rob a bee.
</p></div>

<p>The values for the <i>present</i> Century, viz. 7 and 4, had better be fixed firmly in the memory <i>as a separate item</i>.</p>

<h4>(3) To remember the value of <var>k</var> till it is wanted</h4>

<p>This can be done with one hand. For “0” keep the hand <i>open</i>: for “1,” double in the 1st finger, and put the thumb on it; similarly for “2,” “3,” and “4;” for “5” double in the thumb, and put the fingers on it; for “6,” clench the fist, with the thumb <i>outside</i>.</p>

<h4>(4)</h4>

<p>If it should happen, in working the second part of the Rule, that “4-Rem <i>plus</i> twice 7-Rem” is a multiple of 7, this would make <var>k</var> equal to <var>h</var>; so go on <i>at once</i> to the <i>third</i> part.</p>

<div class="small-remark">
<p>[Thus, if the given Date be “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1731, N.S.,” say “15, 16, 17, <var>a</var> and <var>h</var> are 7 and 3; 4-Rem; 31; 3; 7-Rem; 17, 33, 51; 2; 3 and 4 is 7; <var>a</var> and <var>k</var> are 7 and 3; 1731; 8 and <i>minus</i> 6 is 2, 1 and 1 is 2; 22; and 7 is 29; Defect is 1; 0 and 3 is 3, which does <i>not</i> fall short; add 22; March 25.”]
</p></div>

<h4>(5)</h4>

<p>There is one single Date <span class="annotated corrected" data-ref="annotation-1">(and <i>only</i> one, so far as I know)</span> for which this Rule fails. In the year <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1954, New Style, Easter-Day will fall on the 18th of April: the Rule gives it as the 25th. I cannot in the least account for this very curious anomaly.</p>
<aside class="toggle corrected" id="annotation-1">All exceptions to the Rule as given by Gauss are exceptions here, too. So when the Easter-Date comes out (as in the year 1981) as “April 26,” it really is “April 19.” When it comes out (as in the year 1954) as “April 25,” and the Defect is 28, and the 19-Rem is more than 10, then the correct Easter-Date is “April 18.” W. W. Rouse Ball does give these exceptions in his <i>Mathematical Recreations</i>.</aside>
