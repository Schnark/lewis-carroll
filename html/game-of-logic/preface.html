<h3>Nota Bene</h3>

<p>With each copy of this Book is given an Envelope, containing a diagram (similar to the frontispiece) on card, and nine Counters, four red and five grey.</p>

<p>The Envelope, &amp;c. can be had separately, at 3<i>d</i>. each.
</p><hr class="bigskip">

<p><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-1">The Author will be very grateful for suggestions, especially from beginners in Logic, of any alterations, or further explanations, that may seem desirable. Letters should be addressed to him at “29, Bedford Street, Covent Garden, London.”</span></p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-1">paragraph missing in 1886 edition, where this note comes after the preface</aside>

<h3>Preface</h3>
<div class="motto"><p><span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-2">“There foam’d rebellious Logic, gagg’d and bound.”</span></p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-2"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>The Dunciad</i> by Alexander Pope</aside></div>

<p>This Game requires nine Counters—four of one colour and five of another: say four red and five grey.</p>

<p>Besides the nine Counters, it also requires one Player, <i>at least</i>. I am not aware of any Game that can be played with <i>less</i> than this number: while there are several that require <i>more</i>: take Cricket, for instance, which requires twenty-two. How much easier it is, when you want to play a Game, to find <i>one</i> Player than twenty-two! At the same time, though one Player is enough, a good deal more amusement may be got by two working at it together, and correcting each other’s mistakes.</p>

<p>A second advantage, possessed by this Game, is that, besides being an endless source of amusement (the number of arguments, that may be worked by it, being infinite), it will give the Players a little instruction as well. But is there any great harm in <i>that</i>, so long as you get plenty of amusement?</p>
