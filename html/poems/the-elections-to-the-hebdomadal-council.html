<p>[In the year 1866, a Letter with the above title was published in Oxford, addressed <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-1">by Mr.&nbsp;Goldwin Smith</span> to the Senior Censor of Christ Church, with the twofold object of revealing to the University a vast political misfortune which it had unwittingly encountered, and of suggesting a remedy which should at once alleviate the bitterness of the calamity and secure the sufferers from its recurrence. The misfortune thus revealed was no less than the fact that, at a recent election of Members to the Hebdomadal Council, <i>two</i> Conservatives had been chosen, thus giving a Conservative majority in the Council; and the remedy suggested was a sufficiently sweeping one, embracing, as it did, the following details:—</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-1">only in <i>Phantasmagoria</i></aside>

<p>1. ‘The exclusion’ (from Congregation) ‘of the non-academical elements which form a main part of the strength of this party domination.’ These ‘elements’ are afterwards enumerated as ‘the parish clergy and the professional men of the city, and chaplains who are without any academical occupation.’</p>

<p>2. The abolition of the Hebdomadal Council.</p>

<p>3. The abolition of the legislative functions of Convocation.</p>

<p>These are all the main features of this remarkable scheme of Reform, unless it be necessary to add</p>

<p>4. ‘To preside over a Congregation with full legislative powers, the Vice-Chancellor ought no doubt to be a man of real capacity.’</p>

<p>But it would be invidious to suppose that there was any intention of suggesting this as a novelty.</p>

<p>The following rhythmical version of the Letter developes its principles to an extent which possibly the writer had never contemplated.]</p>

<p class="subtitle">‘Now is the <i>Winter</i> of our discontent<sup id="footnote-1-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.’</p>

<p>‘Heard ye the arrow hurtle in the sky?<br>
Heard ye the dragon-monster’s deathful cry?’—<br>
Excuse this sudden burst of the Heroic;<br>
The present state of things would vex a Stoic!<br>
And just as Sairey Gamp, for pains within,<br>
Administered a modicum of gin,<br>
So does my mind, when vexed and ill at ease,<br>
Console itself with soothing similes.<br>
The ‘dragon-monster’ (pestilential schism!)<br>
I need not tell you is Conservatism;<br>
The ‘hurtling arrow’ (till we find a better)<br>
Is represented by the present Letter.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>’Twas, I remember, but the other day,<br>

<i>I</i> never took to them, and never will<sup id="footnote-3-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>—<br>
What am I saying? Heed it not, my friend:<br>
On the next page I mean to recommend<br>

In the Conservatives! Don’t hint to them<br>
A word of this! (In confidence. Ahem!)<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Need I rehearse the history of Jowett?<br>
I need not, Senior Censor, for you know <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-2">it<sup id="footnote-4-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup></span>.<br>
<i>That</i> was the Board Hebdomadal, and oh!<br>
Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow!<br>
Let each that wears a beard, and each that shaves.<br>
Join in the cry ‘We never will be slaves!’<br>
“But can the University afford<br>
To be a slave to any kind of board?<br>
A <i>slave</i>?” you shuddering ask. “Think you it can, Sir?”<br>
“<i>Not at the present moment</i>,” is my answer<sup id="footnote-5-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup>.<br>
I’ve thought the matter o’er and o’er again,<br>
And given to it all my powers of brain;<br>
I’ve thought it out, and this is what I make it,<br>
(And I don’t care a Tory how you take it:)<br>
<i>It may he right to go ahead, I guess:</i> <span style="font-size: 350%; line-height: 0; position: relative; top: 0.6em; display: inline-block; transform: scaleX(0.75);">}</span><br>
<i>It may be right to stop, I do confess:</i><br>
<i>Also, it may be right to retrogress</i><sup id="footnote-6-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup>.<br>
So says the oracle, and, for myself, I<br>
Must say it beats to fits the one at Delphi!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>To save beloved Oxford from the yoke,<br>
(For this majority’s beyond a joke,)<br>
We must combine<sup id="footnote-7-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup>, aye! hold a <i>caucus</i>-meeting<sup id="footnote-8-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup>,<br>
Unless we want to get another beating.<br>
That they should ‘bottle’ us is nothing new—<br>
But shall they bottle us and <i>caucus</i> too?<br>
See the ‘fell unity of purpose’ now<br>
With which Obstructives plunge into the row<sup id="footnote-9-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup>!<br>
‘Factious Minorities,’ we used to sigh—<br>
‘Factious Majorities!’ is now the cry.<br>
‘Votes—ninety-two’—no combination here:<br>
‘Votes—ninety-three’—conspiracy, ’tis clear<sup id="footnote-10-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup>!<br>
You urge “’Tis but a unit.” I reply<br>
That in that unit lurks their ‘unity.’<br>
<i>Our</i> voters often bolt, and often baulk us,<br>
But then they never, never go to <i>caucus!</i><br>
<i>Our</i> voters can’t forget the maxim famous<br>
‘<i>Semel electum semper eligamus;</i>’<br>
<i>They</i> never can be worked into a ferment<br>
By visionary promise of preferment,<br>
Nor taught, by hints of ‘Paradise<sup id="footnote-11-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup>’ beguiled,<br>
To whisper ‘C for Chairman’ like a <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-3">child<sup id="footnote-12-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup></span>!<br>
And thus the friends that we have tempted down<br>
Oft take the two-o’clock Express for town<sup id="footnote-13-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-13">13</a></sup>.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>This is our danger: this the secret foe<br>
That aims at Oxford such a deadly blow.<br>
What champion can we find to save the State,<br>
To crush the plot? We darkly whisper ‘Wait<sup id="footnote-14-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup>!’<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>My scheme is this: remove the votes of all<br>
The residents that are not Liberal<sup id="footnote-15-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-15">15</a></sup>—<br>
Leave the young Tutors uncontrolled and free,<br>
And Oxford then shall see—what it shall see.<br>
What next? Why then, I say, let Convocation<br>
Be shorn of all her powers of legislation<sup id="footnote-16-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup>.<br>
But why stop there? Let us go boldly on—<br>
Sweep everything beginning with a ‘Con’<br>
Into oblivion! Convocation first,<br>
Conservatism next, and, last and worst,<br>
‘<i>Concilium Hebdomadale</i>’ must,<br>
Consumed and conquered, be consigned to dust<sup id="footnote-17-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-17">17</a></sup>!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And here I must relate a little fable<br>
I heard last Saturday at our high table:—<br>
The cats, it seems, were masters of the house,<br>
And held their own against the rat and mouse:<br>
Of course the others couldn’t stand it long,<br>
So held a <i>caucus</i>, (not, in their case, wrong:)<br>
And, when they were assembled to a man,<br>
Uprose an aged rat, and thus began:—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>‘Brothers in bondage! Shall we bear to be<br>
For ever left in a minority?<br>
With what “fell unity of purpose” cats<br>
Oppress the trusting innocence of rats!<br>
So unsuspicious are we of disguise,<br>
Their machinations take us by surprise<sup id="footnote-18-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-18">18</a></sup>—<br>
Insulting and tyrannical absurdities<sup id="footnote-19-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-19">19</a></sup>!<br>
It is too bad by half—upon my word it is!<br>
For, now that these Con—, cats, I should say, (frizzle ’em!)<br>
Are masters, they exterminate like Islam<sup id="footnote-20-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-20">20</a></sup>!<br>
How shall we deal with them? I’ll tell you how:—<br>
Let none but kittens be allowed to miaow!<br>
The Liberal kittens seize us but in play,<br>
And, while they frolic, we can run away:<br>
But older cats are not so generous,<br>
Their claws are too Conservative for us!<br>
Then let <i>them</i> keep the stable and the oats,<br>
While kittens, rats, and mice have all the <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-4">votes.</span><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>‘Yes; banish cats! The kittens would not use<br>
Their powers for blind obstruction<sup id="footnote-21-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-21">21</a></sup>, nor refuse<br>
To let us sip the cream and gnaw the cheese—<br>
How glorious then would be our destinies<sup id="footnote-22-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-22">22</a></sup>!<br>
Kittens and rats would occupy the throne,<br>
And rule the larder for itself alone<sup id="footnote-23-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-23">23</a></sup>!’<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>So rhymed my friend, and asked me what I thought of it.<br>
I told him that so much as I had caught of it<br>
Appeared to me (as I need hardly mention)<br>
Entirely undeserving of attention.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>But now, to guide the Congregation, when<br>
It numbers none but really ‘able’ men,<br>
A ‘<i>Vice-Cancellarius</i>’ will be needed<br>
Of every kind of human weakness weeded!<br>
Is such the president that we have got?<br>
He ought no doubt to be; why should he not<sup id="footnote-24-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-24">24</a></sup>?<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>I do not hint that Liberals should dare<br>
To oust the present holder of the chair—<br>
But surely he would not object to be<br>
Gently examined by a Board of three?<br>
Their duty being just to ascertain<br>
That he’s ‘all there’ (I mean, of course, in brain),<br>
And that his mind, from ‘petty details’ clear,<br>
Is fitted for the duties of his sphere.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>All this is merely moonshine, till we get<br>
The seal of Parliament upon it set.<br>
A word then, Senior Censor, in your ear:<br>
The Government is in a state of fear—<br>
Like some old gentleman, abroad at night,<br>
Seized with a sudden shiver of affright,<br>
Who offers money, on his bended knees,<br>
To the first skulking vagabond he sees—<br>
Now is the lucky moment for our task;<br>
They daren’t refuse us anything we ask<sup id="footnote-25-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-25">25</a></sup>!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And then our Fellowships shall open be<br>
To Intellect, no meaner quality!<br>
No moral excellence, no social fitness<br>
Shall ever be admissible as witness.<br>
‘Avaunt, dull Virtue!’ is Oxonia’s cry:<br>
‘Come to my arms, ingenious Villainy!’<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>For Classic Fellowships, an honour high,<br>
Simonides and Co. will then apply—<br>
Our Mathematics will to Oxford bring<br>
The ’cutest members of the betting-ring—<br>
Law Fellowships will start upon their journeys<br>
A myriad of unscrupulous attorneys—<br>
While poisoners, doomed till now to toil unknown,<br>
Shall mount the Physical Professor’s throne!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-5">To what a varied feast of learning then<br>
Should we invite our intellectual men!<br>
Professor Caseley should instruct our flock<br>
To analyse the mysteries of Locke—<br>
Barnum should lecture them on Rhetoric—<br>
The Davenports upon the cupboard-trick—<br>
Robson and Redpath, Strahan and Paul and Bates<br>
Should store the minds of undergraduates—<br>
From Fagin’s lecture-room a class should come<br>
Versed in all arts of finger and of thumb,<br>
To illustrate in practice (though by stealth)<br>
The transitory character of wealth.</span><br>
And thus would Oxford educate, indeed,<br>
Men far beyond a merely local need—<br>
With no career before them, I may say<sup id="footnote-26-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-26">26</a></sup>,<br>
Unless they’re wise enough to go away,<br>
And seek, far West, or in the distant East,<br>
Another flock of pigeons to be fleeced.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>I might go on, and trace the destiny<br>
Of Oxford in an age which, though it be<br>

(I mean, of course, the—pshaw! no matter who!)<br>
But, were I to pursue the boundless theme,<br>
I fear that I should seem to you to dream<sup id="footnote-27-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-27">27</a></sup>.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>This to fulfil, or even—humbler far—<br>
To shun Conservatism’s noxious star<br>
And all the evils that it brings behind, <span style="font-size: 350%; line-height: 0; position: relative; top: 0.6em; display: inline-block; transform: scaleX(0.75); left: 4.7rem">}</span><br>
These pestilential coils must be untwined—<br>
These party-coils, that clog the march of Mind—<br>
Choked in whose meshes Oxford, slowly wise,<br>
Has lain for three disastrous centuries<sup id="footnote-28-back" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-28">28</a></sup>.<br>
Away with them! (It is for this I yearn.)<br>
Each twist untwist, each Turner overturn!<br>
Disfranchise each Conservative, and cancel<br>
The votes of Michell, Liddon, Wall, and Mansel!<br>
Then, then shall Oxford be herself again,<br>
Neglect the heart, and cultivate the brain—<br>
Then this shall be the burden of our song,<br>
‘All change is good—whatever is, is wrong’—<br>
Then Intellect’s proud flag shall be unfurled,<br>
And Brain, and Brain alone, shall rule the world!
