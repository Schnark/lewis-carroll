<h2>The year when boilers froze</h2>
<p>Source: perhaps written for Samuel Courthorpe Bosanquet, 1855</p>

<p>The sources claim it was written for Robert Holford Macdowall Bosanquet, but his birthday was July&nbsp;31, not really the date for frozen boilers. Samuel Courthorpe Bosanquet’s birthday was March&nbsp;2, so I think he is the more likely addressee, and historical weather data suggest the year 1855.</p></header>

<div class="verse">
<p>The year when boilers froze and ket-<br>
tles crystallised the fender<br>
The natal day of Bosanquet<br>
Dawned on us in its splendour.</p>

<p>For those who wear wool hosen cat-<br>
ching colds a thing unheard of<br>
But this great maxim Bosanquet<br>
Would not believe a word of.</p>

<p>When Frenchmen say ‘sare, no zank’ et-<br>
iquette suggests the answer<br>
‘A zoughtless, zankless Bosanquet<br>
Would be more zief zan man Sir.’</p>

<p>Dear Bosanquet I’ve here expressed<br>
The grateful feeling that is<br>
But due to one who treats his guest<br>
To genuine oyster patties.
