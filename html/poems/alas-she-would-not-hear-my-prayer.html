<div class="verse">
<p>Alas! she would not hear my prayer!<br>
Yet it were rash to tear my hair;<br>
Disfigured, I should be less fair.</p>

<p>She was unwise, I may say blind;<br>
Once she was lovingly inclined;<br>
Some circumstance has changed her mind.
</p><hr class="bigskip">

<p>Well! so my offer was no go!<br>
She might do worse, I told her so;<br>
She was a fool to answer “No.”</p>

<p>However, things are as they stood;<br>
Nor would I have her if I could,<br>
For there are plenty more as good.
</p><hr class="bigskip">

<p>Firebrands and daggers! hope hath fled!<br>
To atoms dash the doubly dead!<br>
My brain is fire—my heart is lead!</p>

<p>Her soul is flint, and what am I?<br>
Scorch’d by her fierce, relentless eye.<br>
Nothingness is my destiny!
