<div class="verse">
<p>“Just the place for a Snark!” the Bellman cried,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>As he landed his crew with care;<br>
Supporting each man on the top of the tide<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>By a finger entwined in his hair.</p>

<p>“Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That alone should encourage the crew.<br>
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>What I tell you three times is true.”</p>

<p>The crew was complete: it included a Boots—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A maker of Bonnets and Hoods—<br>
A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And a Broker, to value their goods.</p>

</figcaption></figure>

<p>A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Might perhaps have won more than his share—<br>
But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Had the whole of their cash in his care.</p>

<p>There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Or would sit making lace in the bow:<br>
And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Though none of the sailors knew how.</p>

<p>There was one who was famed for the number of things<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>He forgot when he entered the ship:<br>
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And the clothes he had bought for the trip.</p>

<p>He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>With his name painted clearly on each:<br>
But since he omitted to mention the fact,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They were all left behind on the beach.</p>

<p>The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>He had seven coats on when he came,<br>
With three pair of boots—but the worst of it was<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>He had wholly forgotten his name.</p>

<figure>
<img src="../../images/snark/02.jpg" width="240" height="360" alt="The Baker and other members of the crew on the ship.">

<figcaption>“He had wholly forgotten his name”
</figcaption></figure>

<p>He would answer to “Hi!” or to any loud cry,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Such as “Fry me!” or “Fritter my wig!”<br>
To “What-you-may-call-um!” or “What-was-his-name!”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>But especially “Thing-um-a-jig!”</p>

<p>While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>He had different names from these:<br>
His intimate friends called him “Candle-ends,”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And his enemies “Toasted-cheese.”</p>

<p>“His form is ungainly—his intellect small—”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(So the Bellman would often remark)—<br>
“But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.”</p>

<p>He would joke with hyænas, returning their stare<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>With an impudent wag of the head:<br>
And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Just to keep up its spirits,” he said.</p>

<p>He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad—<br>
He could only bake Bride-cake—for which, I may state,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>No materials were to be had.</p>

<p>The last of the crew needs especial remark,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Though he looked an incredible dunce:<br>
He had just one idea—but, that one being “Snark,”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The good Bellman engaged him at once.</p>

<p>He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>When the ship had been sailing a week,<br>
He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And was almost too frightened to speak:</p>

<p>But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>There was only one Beaver on board;<br>
And that was a tame one he had of his own,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Whose death would be deeply deplored.</p>

<p>The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Protested, with tears in its eyes,<br>
That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Could atone for that dismal surprise!</p>

<p>It strongly advised that the Butcher should be<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Conveyed in a separate ship:<br>
But the Bellman declared that would never agree<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>With the plans he had made for the trip:</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>“The Beaver kept looking the opposite way”
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Navigation was always a difficult art,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Though with only one ship and one bell:<br>
And he feared he must really decline, for his part,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Undertaking another as well.</p>

<p>The Beaver’s best course was, no doubt, to procure<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A second-hand dagger-proof coat—<br>
So the Baker advised it—and next, to insure<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Its life in some Office of note:</p>

<p>This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(On moderate terms), or for sale,<br>
Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And one Against Damage From Hail.</p>

<p>Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Whenever the Butcher was by,<br>
The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And appeared unaccountably shy.
</p></div>

<h3 id="fit-the-second-the-bellmans-speech"><span class="textfrak">Fit the Second.</span> The Bellman’s Speech.</h3>

<div class="verse">
<p>The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!<br>
Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The moment one looked in his face!</p>

<p>He had bought a large map representing the sea,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Without the least vestige of land:<br>
And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A map they could all understand.</p>

<p>“What’s the good of Mercator’s North Poles and Equators,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?”<br>
So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“They are merely conventional signs!</p>

<figure>
<img src="../../images/snark/04.jpg" width="240" height="360" alt="A blank map with nautical terms written on the border.">

<figcaption>Ocean-Chart
</figcaption></figure>

<p>“Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>But we’ve got our brave Captain to thank”<br>
(So the crew would protest) “that he’s bought <i>us</i> the best—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A perfect and absolute blank!”</p>

<p>This was charming, no doubt: but they shortly found out<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That the Captain they trusted so well<br>
Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And that was to tingle his bell.</p>

<p>He was thoughtful and grave—but the orders he gave<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Were enough to bewilder a crew.<br>
When he cried “Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>What on earth was the helmsman to do?</p>

<p>Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:<span id="snark:bowsprit"></span><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A thing, as the Bellman remarked,<br>
That frequently happens in tropical climes,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>When a vessel is, so to speak, “snarked.”</p>

<p>But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,<br>
Said he <i>had</i> hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That the ship would <i>not</i> travel due West!</p>

<p>But the danger was past—they had landed at last,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:<br>
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Which consisted of chasms and crags.</p>

<p>The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And repeated in musical tone<br>
Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>But the crew would do nothing but groan.</p>

<p>He served out some grog with a liberal hand,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And bade them sit down on the beach:<br>
And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>As he stood and delivered his speech.</p>

<p>“Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(They were all of them fond of quotations:<br>
So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>While he served out additional rations).</p>

<p>“We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(Four weeks to the month you may mark),<br>
But never as yet (’tis your Captain who speaks)<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!</p>

<p>“We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(Seven days to the week I allow),<br>
But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>We have never beheld till now!</p>

<p>“Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The five unmistakable marks<br>
By which you may know, wheresoever you go,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The warranted genuine Snarks.</p>

<p>“Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:<br>
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>With a flavour of Will-o-the-wisp.</p>

<p>“Its habit of getting up late you’ll agree<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That it carries too far, when I say<br>
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o’clock tea,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And dines on the following day.</p>

<p>“The third is its slowness in taking a jest.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Should you happen to venture on one,<br>
It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And it always looks grave at a pun.</p>

<p>“The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Which it constantly carries about,<br>
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A sentiment open to doubt.</p>

<p>“The fifth is ambition. It next will be right<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>To describe each particular batch:<br>
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>From those that have whiskers, and scratch.</p>

<p>“For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Yet I feel it my duty to say<br>
Some are Boojums—” The Bellman broke off in alarm,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>For the Baker had fainted away.
</p></div>

<h3 id="fit-the-third-the-bakers-tale"><span class="textfrak">Fit the Third.</span> The Baker’s Tale.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>They roused him with muffins—they roused him with ice—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They roused him with mustard and cress—<br>
They roused him with jam and judicious advice—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They set him conundrums to guess.</p>

<p>When at length he sat up and was able to speak,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>His sad story he offered to tell;<br>
And the Bellman cried “Silence! Not even a shriek!”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And excitedly tingled his bell.</p>

<p>There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Scarcely even a howl or a groan,<br>
As the man they called “Ho!” told his story of woe<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>In an antediluvian tone.</p>

<p>“My father and mother were honest, though poor—”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Skip all that!” cried the Bellman in haste.<br>
“If it once becomes dark, there’s no chance of a Snark—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>We have hardly a minute to waste!”</p>

<p>“I skip forty years,” said the Baker, in tears,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“And proceed without further remark<br>
To the day when you took me aboard of your ship<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>To help you in hunting the Snark.</p>

<p>“A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Remarked, when I bade him farewell—”<br>
“Oh, skip your dear uncle!” the Bellman exclaimed,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>As he angrily tingled his bell.</p>

<p>“He remarked to me then,” said that mildest of men,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“‘If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:<br>
Fetch it home by all means—you may serve it with greens<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And it’s handy for striking a light.</p>

<p>“‘You may seek it with thimbles—and seek it with care;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>You may hunt it with forks and hope;<br>
You may threaten its life with a railway-share;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>You may charm it with smiles and soap—’”</p>

<p>(“That’s exactly the method,” the Bellman bold<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>In a hasty parenthesis cried,<br>
“That’s exactly the way I have always been told<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That the capture of Snarks should be tried!”)</p>

<p>“‘But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>If your Snark be a Boojum! For then<br>
You will softly and suddenly vanish away,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And never be met with again!’</p>

<p>“It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>When I think of my uncle’s last words:<br>
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Brimming over with quivering curds!</p>

<p>“It is this, it is this—” “We have had that before!”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The Bellman indignantly said.<br>
And the Baker replied “Let me say it once more.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It is this, it is this that I dread!</p>

<p>“I engage with the Snark—every night after dark—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>In a dreamy delirious fight:<br>
I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And I use it for striking a light:</p>

<p>“But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,<br>

I shall softly and suddenly vanish away—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And the notion I cannot endure!”

<p>The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“If only you’d spoken before!<br>
It’s excessively awkward to mention it now,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!</p>

<p>“We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>If you never were met with again—<br>
But surely, my man, when the voyage began,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>You might have suggested it then?</p>

<p>“It’s excessively awkward to mention it now—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>As I think I’ve already remarked.”<br>
And the man they called “Hi!” replied, with a sigh,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“I informed you the day we embarked.</p>

<p>“You may charge me with murder—or want of sense—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(We are all of us weak at times):<br>
But the slightest approach to a false pretence<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Was never among my crimes!</p>

<p>“I said it in Hebrew—I said it in Dutch—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>I said it in German and Greek:<br>
But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That English is what you speak!”</p>

<p>“’Tis a pitiful tale,” said the Bellman, whose face<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Had grown longer at every word:<br>
“But, now that you’ve stated the whole of your case,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>More debate would be simply absurd.</p>

<p>“The rest of my speech” (he explained to his men)<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“You shall hear when I’ve leisure to speak it.<br>
But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>’Tis your glorious duty to seek it!</p>

<p>“To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>To pursue it with forks and hope;<br>
To threaten its life with a railway-share;<br>

<p>“For the Snark’s a peculiar creature, that won’t<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Be caught in a commonplace way.<br>
Do all that you know, and try all that you don’t:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Not a chance must be wasted to-day!</p>

<p>“For England expects—I forbear to proceed:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>’Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:<br>
And you’d best be unpacking the things that you need<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>To rig yourselves out for the fight.”</p>

<p>Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed),<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And changed his loose silver for notes:<br>
The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And shook the dust out of his coats:</p>

<p>The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Each working the grindstone in turn:<br>
But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>No interest in the concern:</p>

<p>Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And vainly proceeded to cite<br>
A number of cases, in which making laces<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Had been proved an infringement of right.</p>

<p>The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A novel arrangement of bows:<br>
While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Was chalking the tip of his nose.</p>

<p>But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>With yellow kid gloves and a ruff—<br>
Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Which the Bellman declared was all “stuff.”</p>

<p>“Introduce me, now there’s a good fellow,” he said,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“If we happen to meet it together!”<br>
And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Said “That must depend on the weather.”</p>

<p>The Beaver went simply galumphing about,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>At seeing the Butcher so shy:<br>
And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Made an effort to wink with one eye.</p>

<p>“Be a man!” <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-1">cried</span> the Bellman in wrath, as he heard<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The Butcher beginning to sob.<br>
“Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>We shall need all our strength for the job!”

<h3 id="fit-the-fifth-the-beavers-lesson"><span class="textfrak">Fit the Fifth.</span> The Beaver’s Lesson.</h3>

<div class="verse">
<p>They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They pursued it with forks and hope;<br>
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They charmed it with smiles and soap.</p>

<p>Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>For making a separate sally;<br>
And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A dismal and desolate valley.</p>

<p>But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It had chosen the very same place:<br>
Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The disgust that appeared in his face.</p>

<p>Each thought he was thinking of nothing but “Snark”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And the glorious work of the day;<br>
And each tried to pretend that he did not remark<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That the other was going that way.</p>

<p>But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And the evening got darker and colder,<br>
Till (merely from nervousness, not from good will)<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They marched along shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And they knew that some danger was near:<br>
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And even the Butcher felt queer.</p>

<p>He thought of his childhood, left far far behind—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That blissful and innocent state—<br>
The sound so exactly recalled to his mind<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A pencil that squeaks on a slate!</p>

<p>“’Tis the voice of the Jubjub!” he suddenly cried.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(This man, that they used to call “Dunce.”)<br>
“As the Bellman would tell you,” he added with pride,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“I have uttered that sentiment once.”</p>

<p>“’Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>You will find I have told it you twice.<br>
’Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>If only I’ve stated it thrice.”</p>

<p>The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Attending to every word:<br>
But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>When the third repetition occurred.</p>

<p>It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It had somehow contrived to lose count,<br>
And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>By reckoning up the amount.</p>

<p>“Two added to one—if that could but be done,”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It said, “with one’s fingers and thumbs!”<br>
Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It had taken no pains with its sums.</p>

<p>“The thing can be done,” said the Butcher, “I think.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The thing must be done, I am sure.<br>
The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The best there is time to procure.”</p>

<p>The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And ink in unfailing supplies:<br>
While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And watched them with wondering eyes.</p>

<p>So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>As he wrote with a pen in each hand,<br>
And explained all the while in a popular style<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Which the Beaver could well understand.</p>

<p>“Taking Three as the subject to reason about—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A convenient number to state—<br>
We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>By One Thousand diminished by Eight.</p>

<p>“The result we proceed to divide, as you see,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>By Nine-Hundred-and-Ninety-and-Two:<br>
Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Exactly and perfectly true.</p>

<p>“The method employed I would gladly explain,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>While I have it so clear in my head,<br>
If I had but the time and you had but the brain—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>But much yet remains to be said.</p>

<p>“In one moment I’ve seen what has hitherto been<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Enveloped in absolute mystery,<br>
And without extra charge I will give you at large<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A Lesson in Natural History.”</p>

<p>In his genial way he proceeded to say<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(Forgetting all laws of propriety,<br>
And that giving instruction, without introduction,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),</p>

<p>“As to temper the Jubjub’s a desperate bird,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Since it lives in perpetual passion:<br>
Its taste in costume is entirely absurd—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It is ages ahead of the fashion:</p>

<p>“But it knows any friend it has met once before:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It never will look at a bribe:<br>
And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And collects—though it does not subscribe.</p>

<p>“Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:<br>
(Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And some, in mahogany kegs:)</p>

<p>“You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>You condense it with locusts and tape:<br>
Still keeping one principal object in view—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>To preserve its symmetrical shape.”</p>

<p>The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>But he felt that the Lesson must end,<br>
And he wept with delight in attempting to say<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>He considered the Beaver his friend:</p>

<p>While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>More eloquent even than tears,<br>
It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Would have taught it in seventy years.</p>

<p>They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(For a moment) with noble emotion,<br>
Said “This amply repays all the wearisome days<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>We have spent on the billowy ocean!”</p>

<p>Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Have seldom if ever been known;<br>
In winter or summer, ’twas always the same—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>You could never meet either alone.</p>

<p>And when quarrels arose—as one frequently finds<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour—<br>
The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And cemented their friendship for ever!

<h3 id="fit-the-sixth-the-barristers-dream"><span class="textfrak">Fit the Sixth.</span> The Barrister’s Dream.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They pursued it with forks and hope;<br>
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They charmed it with smiles and soap.</p>

<p>But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That the Beaver’s lace-making was wrong,<br>
Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That his fancy had dwelt on so long.</p>

<p>He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,<br>
Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>On the charge of deserting its sty.</p>

<figure>
<img src="../../images/snark/08.jpg" width="360" height="244" alt="The Barrister dreaming of the court-room.">

<figcaption>“‘You must know—’ said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed ‘Fudge!’”
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That the sty was deserted when found:<br>
And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>In a soft under-current of sound.</p>

<p>The indictment had never been clearly expressed,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And it seemed that the Snark had begun,<br>
And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>What the pig was supposed to have done.</p>

<p>The Jury had each formed a different view<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(Long before the indictment was read),<br>
And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>One word that the others had said.</p>

<p>“You must know—” said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed “Fudge!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That statute is obsolete quite!<br>
Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>On an ancient manorial right.</p>

<p>“In the matter of Treason the pig would appear<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>To have aided, but scarcely abetted:<br>
While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>If you grant the plea ‘never indebted.’</p>

<p>“The fact of Desertion I will not dispute:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>But its guilt, as I trust, is removed<br>
(So far as relates to the costs of this suit)<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>By the Alibi which has been proved.</p>

<p>“My poor client’s fate now depends on your votes.”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Here the speaker sat down in his place,<br>
And directed the Judge to refer to his notes<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And briefly to sum up the case.</p>

<p>But the Judge said he never had summed up before;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>So the Snark undertook it instead,<br>
And summed it so well that it came to far more<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Than the Witnesses ever had said!</p>

<p>When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>As the word was so puzzling to spell;<br>
But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn’t mind<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Undertaking that duty as well.</p>

<p>So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It was spent with the toils of the day:<br>
When it said the word “GUILTY!” the Jury all groaned<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And some of them fainted away.</p>

<p>Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Too nervous to utter a word:<br>
When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And the fall of a pin might be heard.</p>

<p>“Transportation for life” was the sentence it gave,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“And <i>then</i> to be fined forty pound.”<br>
The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That the phrase was not legally sound.</p>

<p>But their wild exultation was suddenly checked<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>When the jailer informed them, with tears,<br>
Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>As the pig had been dead for some years.</p>

<p>The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>But the Snark, though a little aghast,<br>
As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Went bellowing on to the last.</p>

<p>Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>To grow every moment more clear:<br>
Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.
</p></div>

<h3 id="fit-the-seventh-the-bankers-fate"><span class="textfrak">Fit the Seventh.</span> The Banker’s Fate.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They pursued it with forks and hope;<br>
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They charmed it with smiles and soap.</p>

<p>And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It was matter for general remark,<br>
Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>In his zeal to discover the Snark.</p>

<p>But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh<br>
And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>For he knew it was useless to fly.</p>

<p>He offered large discount—he offered a cheque<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(Drawn “to bearer”) for seven-pounds-ten:<br>
But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And grabbed at the Banker again.</p>

<p>Without rest or pause—while those frumious jaws<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Went savagely snapping around—<br>
He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Till fainting he fell to the ground.</p>

<p>The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Led on by that fear-stricken yell:<br>
And the Bellman remarked “It is just as I feared!”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And solemnly tolled on his bell.</p>

<p>He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The least likeness to what he had been:<br>
While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A wonderful thing to be seen!</p>

<p>To the horror of all who were present that day,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>He uprose in full evening dress,<br>
And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>What his tongue could no longer express.</p>

<p>Down he sank in a chair—ran his hands through his hair—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And chanted in mimsiest tones<br>
Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>While he rattled a couple of bones.</p>

<p>“Leave him here to his fate—it is getting so late!”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.<br>
“We have lost half the day. Any further delay,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And we sha’n’t catch a Snark before night!”

<p>They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And the Beaver, excited at last,<br>
Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>For the daylight was nearly past.</p>

<p>“There is Thingumbob shouting!” the Bellman said.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“He is shouting like mad, only hark!<br>
He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,<br>

<p>They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“He was always a desperate wag!”<br>
They beheld him—their Baker—their hero unnamed—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>On the top of a neighbouring crag,</p>

<p>Erect and sublime, for one moment of time.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>In the next, that wild figure they saw<br>
(As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>While they waited and listened in awe.</p>

<p>“It’s a Snark!” was the sound that first came to their ears,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And seemed almost too good to be true.<br>
Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Then the ominous words “It’s a Boo—”</p>

<p>Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A weary and wandering sigh<br>
That sounded like “—jum!” but the others declare<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It was only a breeze that went by.</p>

<p>They hunted till darkness came on, but they found<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Not a button, or feather, or mark,<br>
By which they could tell that they stood on the ground<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Where the Baker had met with the Snark.</p>

<p>In the midst of the word he was trying to say,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>In the midst of his laughter and glee,<br>
He had softly and suddenly vanished away—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>For the Snark <i>was</i> a Boojum, you see.
