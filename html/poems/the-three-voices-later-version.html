</figure>

<p>He trilled a carol fresh and free:<br>
He laughed aloud for very glee:<br>
There came a breeze from off the sea:</p>

<p>It passed athwart the glooming flat—<br>
It fanned his forehead as he sat—<br>
It lightly bore away his hat,</p>

<p>All to the feet of one who stood<br>
Like maid enchanted in a wood,<br>
Frowning as darkly as she could.</p>

<p>With huge umbrella, lank and brown,<br>
Unerringly she pinned it down,<br>
Right through the centre of the crown.</p>

<p>Then, with an aspect cold and grim,<br>
Regardless of its battered rim,<br>
She took it up and gave it him.</p>

<p>A while like one in dreams he stood,<br>
Then faltered forth his gratitude<br>
In words just short of being rude:</p>

<p>For it had lost its shape and shine,<br>
And it had cost him four-and-nine,<br>
And he was going out to dine.</p>

<figure style="max-width:75%;">
<img src="../../images/rhyme/101.jpg" width="253" height="360" alt="A woman attacks the hat with her umbrella.">

<figcaption>“Unerringly she pinned it down”
</figcaption></figure>

<p>“To dine!” she sneered in acid tone.<br>
“To bend thy being to a bone<br>
Clothed in a radiance not its own!”</p>

<p>The tear-drop trickled to his chin:<br>
There was a meaning in her grin<br>
That made him feel on fire within.</p>

<p>“Term it not ‘radiance,’” said he:<br>
“’Tis solid nutriment to me.<br>
Dinner is Dinner: Tea is Tea.”</p>

<p>And she “Yea so? Yet wherefore cease?<br>
Let thy scant knowledge find increase.<br>
Say ‘Men are Men, and Geese are Geese.’”</p>

<p>He moaned: he knew not what to say.<br>
The thought “That I could get away!”<br>
Strove with the thought “But I must stay.”</p>

<p>“To dine!” she shrieked in dragon-wrath.<br>
“To swallow wines all foam and froth!<br>
To simper at a table-cloth!</p>

<p>“Say, can thy noble spirit stoop<br>
To join the gormandising troop<br>
Who find a solace in the soup?</p>

<p>“Canst thou desire or pie or puff?<br>
Thy well-bred manners were enough,<br>
Without such gross material stuff.”</p>

<p>“Yet well-bred men,” he faintly said,<br>
“Are not unwilling to be fed:<br>
Nor are they well without the bread.”</p>

<p>Her visage scorched him ere she spoke:<br>
“There are,” she said, “a kind of folk<br>
Who have no horror of a joke.</p>

<p>“Such wretches live: they take their share<br>
Of common earth and common air:<br>
We come across them here and there:</p>

<p>“We grant them—there is no escape—<br>
A sort of semi-human shape<br>
Suggestive of the man-like Ape.”</p>

<p>“In all such theories,” said he,<br>
“One fixed exception there must be.<br>
That is, the Present Company.”</p>

<p>Baffled, she gave a wolfish bark:<br>
He, aiming blindly in the dark,<br>
With random shaft had pierced the mark.</p>

<p>She felt that her defeat was plain,<br>
Yet madly strove with might and main<br>
To get the upper hand again.</p>

<p>Fixing her eyes upon the beach,<br>
As though unconscious of his speech,<br>
She said “Each gives to more than each.”</p>

<p>He could not answer yea or nay:<br>
He faltered “Gifts may pass away.”<br>
Yet knew not what he meant to say.</p>

<p>“If that be so,” she straight replied,<br>
“Each heart with each doth coincide.<br>
What boots it? For the world is wide.”</p>

<figure style="max-width:75%;">
<img src="../../images/rhyme/105.jpg" width="249" height="360" alt="The man and the woman are standing next to each other, in front of them the hat.">

<figcaption>“He faltered ‘Gifts may pass away.’”
</figcaption></figure>

<p>“The world is but a Thought,” said he:<br>
“The vast unfathomable sea<br>
Is but a Notion—unto me.”</p>

<p>And darkly fell her answer dread<br>
Upon his unresisting head,<br>
Like half a hundredweight of lead.</p>

<p>“The Good and Great must ever shun<br>
That reckless and abandoned one<br>
Who stoops to perpetrate a pun.</p>

<p>“The man that smokes—that reads the <i>Times</i>—<br>
That goes to Christmas Pantomimes—<br>
Is capable of <i>any</i> crimes!”</p>

<p>He felt it was his turn to speak,<br>
And, with a shamed and crimson cheek,<br>
Moaned “This is harder than Bezique!”</p>

<p>But when she asked him “Wherefore so?”<br>
He felt his very whiskers glow,<br>
And frankly owned “I do not know.”</p>

<figure style="max-width:75%;">
<img src="../../images/rhyme/107.jpg" width="254" height="360" alt="They are turning away from each other.">

<figcaption>“This is harder than Bezique!”
</figcaption></figure>

<p>While, like broad waves of golden grain,<br>
Or sunlit hues on cloistered pane,<br>
His colour came and went again.</p>

<p>Pitying his obvious distress,<br>
Yet with a tinge of bitterness,<br>
She said “The More exceeds the Less.”</p>

<p>“A truth of such undoubted weight,”<br>
He urged, “and so extreme in date,<br>
It were superfluous to state.”</p>

<p>Roused into sudden passion, she<br>
In tone of cold malignity:<br>
“To others, yea: but not to thee.”</p>

<p>But when she saw him quail and quake,<br>
And when he urged “For pity’s sake!”<br>
Once more in gentle tone she spake.</p>

<p>“Thought in the mind doth still abide:<br>
That is by Intellect supplied,<br>
And within that Idea doth hide:</p>

<p>“And he, that yearns the truth to know,<br>
Still further inwardly may go,<br>
And find Idea from Notion flow:</p>

<p>“And thus the chain, that sages sought,<br>
Is to a glorious circle wrought,<br>
For Notion hath its source in Thought.”</p>

<p>So passed they on with even pace:<br>
Yet gradually one might trace<br>
A shadow growing on his face.

</figure>

<p>They walked beside the wave-worn beach;<br>
Her tongue was very apt to teach,<br>
And now and then he did beseech</p>

<p>She would abate her dulcet tone,<br>
Because the talk was all her own,<br>
And he was dull as any drone.</p>

<p>She urged “No cheese is made of chalk”:<br>
And ceaseless flowed her dreary talk,<br>
Tuned to the footfall of a walk.</p>

<p>Her voice was very full and rich,<br>
And, when at length she asked him “Which?”<br>
It mounted to its highest pitch.</p>

<p>He a bewildered answer gave,<br>
Drowned in the sullen moaning wave,<br>
Lost in the echoes of the cave.</p>

<p>He answered her he knew not what:<br>
Like shaft from bow at random shot,<br>
He spoke, but she regarded not.</p>

<p>She waited not for his reply,<br>
But with a downward leaden eye<br>
Went on as if he were not by:</p>

<p>Sound argument and grave defence,<br>
Strange questions raised on “Why?” and “Whence?”<br>
And wildly tangled evidence.</p>

<p>When he, with racked and whirling brain,<br>
Feebly implored her to explain,<br>
She simply said it all again.</p>

<p>Wrenched with an agony intense,<br>
He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense,<br>
And careless of all consequence:</p>

<p>“Mind—I believe—is Essence—Ent—<br>
Abstract—that is—an Accident—<br>
Which we—that is to say—I meant—”</p>

<p>When, with quick breath and cheeks all flushed,<br>
At length his speech was somewhat hushed,<br>
She looked at him, and he was crushed.</p>

<p>It needed not her calm reply:<br>
She fixed him with a stony eye,<br>
And he could neither fight nor fly,</p>

<p>While she dissected, word by word,<br>
His speech, half guessed at and half heard,<br>
As might a cat a little bird.</p>

<figure style="max-width:75%;">
<img src="../../images/rhyme/113.jpg" width="253" height="360" alt="The man and the woman are walking next to each other (seen from front).">

<figcaption>“He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense”
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Then, having wholly overthrown<br>
His views, and stripped them to the bone,<br>
Proceeded to unfold her own.</p>

<p>“Shall Man be Man? And shall he miss<br>
Of other thoughts no thought but this,<br>
Harmonious dews of sober bliss?</p>

<p>“What boots it? Shall his fevered eye<br>
Through towering nothingness descry<br>
The grisly phantom hurry by?</p>

<p>“And hear dumb shrieks that fill the air;<br>
See mouths that gape, and eyes that stare<br>
And redden in the dusky glare?</p>

<p>“The meadows breathing amber light,<br>
The darkness toppling from the height,<br>
The feathery train of granite Night?</p>

<p>“Shall he, grown gray among his peers,<br>
Through the thick curtain of his tears<br>
Catch glimpses of his earlier years,</p>

<figure style="max-width:75%;">
<img src="../../images/rhyme/115.jpg" width="253" height="360" alt="The man has taken his hat off.">

<figcaption>“Shall Man be Man?”
</figcaption></figure>

<p>“And hear the sounds he knew of yore,<br>
Old shufflings on the sanded floor,<br>
Old knuckles tapping at the door?</p>

<p>“Yet still before him as he flies<br>
One pallid form shall ever rise,<br>
And, bodying forth in glassy eyes</p>

<p>“The vision of a vanished good,<br>
Low peering through the tangled wood,<br>
Shall freeze the current of his blood.”</p>

<p>Still from each fact, with skill uncouth<br>
And savage rapture, like a tooth<br>
She wrenched some slow reluctant truth.</p>

<p>Till, like a silent water-mill,<br>
When summer suns have dried the rill,<br>
She reached a full stop, and was still.</p>

<p>Dead calm succeeded to the fuss,<br>
As when the loaded omnibus<br>
Has reached the railway terminus:</p>

<p>When, for the tumult of the street,<br>
Is heard the engine’s stifled beat,<br>
The velvet tread of porters’ feet.</p>

<p>With glance that ever sought the ground,<br>
She moved her lips without a sound,<br>
And every now and then she frowned.</p>

<p>He gazed upon the sleeping sea,<br>
And joyed in its tranquillity,<br>
And in that silence dead, but she</p>

<p>To muse a little space did seem,<br>
Then, like the echo of a dream,<br>
Harped back upon her threadbare theme.</p>

<p>Still an attentive ear he lent<br>
But could not fathom what she meant:<br>
She was not deep, nor eloquent.</p>

<p>He marked the ripple on the sand:<br>
The even swaying of her hand<br>
Was all that he could understand.</p>

<p>He saw in dreams a drawing-room,<br>
Where thirteen wretches sat in gloom,<br>
Waiting—he thought he knew for whom:</p>

<p>He saw them drooping here and there,<br>
Each feebly huddled on a chair,<br>
In attitudes of blank despair:</p>

<p>Oysters were not more mute than they,<br>
For all their brains were pumped away,<br>
And they had nothing more to say—</p>

<p>Save one, who groaned “Three hours are gone!”<br>
Who shrieked “We’ll wait no longer, John!<br>
Tell them to set the dinner on!”</p>

<p>The vision passed: the ghosts were fled:<br>
He saw once more that woman dread:<br>
He heard once more the words she said.</p>

<p>He left her, and he turned aside:<br>
He sat and watched the coming tide<br>
Across the shores so newly dried.</p>

<figcaption>“He sat and watched the coming tide”
</figcaption></figure>

<p>He wondered at the waters clear,<br>
The breeze that whispered in his ear,<br>
The billows heaving far and near,</p>

<p>And why he had so long preferred<br>
To hang upon her every word:<br>
“In truth,” he said, “it was absurd.”

<h3><span class="textfrak">The Third Voice</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<figure style="max-width:75%;">
<img src="../../images/rhyme/121.jpg" width="288" height="220" alt="The man is crying.">
</figure>

<p>Not long this transport held its place:<br>
Within a little moment’s space<br>
Quick tears were raining down his face.</p>

<p>His heart stood still, aghast with fear;<br>
A wordless voice, nor far nor near,<br>
He seemed to hear and not to hear.</p>

<p>“Tears kindle not the doubtful spark.<br>
If so, why not? Of this remark<br>
The bearings are profoundly dark.”</p>

<p>“Her speech,” he said, “hath caused this pain.<br>
Easier I count it to explain<br>
The jargon of the howling main,</p>

<p>“Or, stretched beside some babbling brook,<br>
To con, with inexpressive look,<br>
An unintelligible book.”</p>

<p>Low spake the voice within his head,<br>
In words imagined more than said,<br>
Soundless as ghost’s intended tread:</p>

<p>“If thou art duller than before,<br>
Why quittedst thou the voice of lore?<br>
Why not endure, expecting more?”</p>

<p>“Rather than that,” he groaned aghast,<br>
“I’d writhe in depths of cavern vast,<br>
Some loathly vampire’s rich repast.”</p>

<figure style="max-width:75%;">
<img src="../../images/rhyme/123.jpg" width="252" height="360" alt="The man is looking up aghast.">

<figcaption>“He groaned aghast”
</figcaption></figure>

<p>“’Twere hard,” it answered, “themes immense<br>
To coop within the narrow fence<br>
That rings <i>thy</i> scant intelligence.”</p>

<p>“Not so,” he urged, “nor once alone:<br>
But there was something in her tone<br>
That chilled me to the very bone.</p>

<p>“Her style was anything but clear,<br>
And most unpleasantly severe;<br>
Her epithets were very queer.</p>

<p>“And yet, so grand were her replies,<br>
I could not choose but deem her wise;<br>
I did not dare to criticise;</p>

<p>“Nor did I leave her, till she went<br>
So deep in tangled argument<br>
That all my powers of thought were spent.”</p>

<p>A little whisper inly slid,<br>
“Yet truth is truth: you know you did.”<br>
A little wink beneath the lid.</p>

<p>And, sickened with excess of dread,<br>
Prone to the dust he bent his head,<br>
And lay like one three-quarters dead.</p>

<p>The whisper left him—like a breeze<br>
Lost in the depths of leafy trees—<br>
Left him by no means at his ease.</p>

<p>Once more he weltered in despair,<br>
With hands, through denser-matted hair,<br>
More tightly clenched than then they were.</p>

<p>When, bathed in Dawn of living red,<br>
Majestic frowned the mountain head,<br>
“Tell me my fault,” was all he said.</p>

<p>When, at high Noon, the blazing sky<br>
Scorched in his head each haggard eye,<br>
Then keenest rose his weary cry.</p>

<p>And when at Eve the unpitying sun<br>
Smiled grimly on the solemn fun,<br>
“Alack,” he sighed, “what <i>have</i> I done?”</p>

<figure style="max-width:75%;">

<figcaption>“Tortured, unaided, and alone”
</figcaption></figure>

<p>But saddest, darkest was the sight,<br>
When the cold grasp of leaden Night<br>
Dashed him to earth, and held him tight.</p>

<p>Tortured, unaided, and alone,<br>
Thunders were silence to his groan,<br>
Bagpipes sweet music to its tone:</p>

<p>“What? Ever thus, in dismal round,<br>
Shall Pain and Mystery profound<br>
Pursue me like a sleepless hound,</p>

<p>“With crimson-dashed and eager jaws,<br>
Me, still in ignorance of the cause,<br>
Unknowing what I broke of laws?”</p>

<p>The whisper to his ear did seem<br>
Like echoed flow of silent stream,<br>
Or shadow of forgotten dream,</p>

<p>The whisper trembling in the wind:<br>
“Her fate with thine was intertwined,”<br>
So spake it in his inner mind:</p>

<p>“Each orbed on each a baleful star:<br>
Each proved the other’s blight and bar:<br>
Each unto each were best, most far:</p>

<p>“Yea, each to each was worse than foe:<br>
Thou, a scared dullard, gibbering low,<br>
