<div class="verse">
<p>Three little maidens, weary of the Rail—<br>
Three pair of little ears, listening to a tale—<br>
Three little hands, held out in readiness<br>
For three little puzzles, very hard to guess—<br>
Three pair of little eyes, opened wonder-wide<br>
At three little scissors lying side by side—<br>
Three little mouths, that thanked an unknown friend<br>
For one little book he undertook to send—<br>
Tho’ whether they’ll remember the friend, or book, or day,<br>
For three little weeks, is more than I can say.
