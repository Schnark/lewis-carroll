<div class="verse">
<p>Well, if you must know all the facts, I was merely reading a pamphlet<br>
When what should I hear at the door but a knock as soft as a Zephyr.<br>
I listened and heard it again, so, as loud as I possibly could call,<br>
I shouted “Don’t stand waiting there, come in, let me know who you are, sir!”<br>
Mild he entered the room, with his hat in his hand and his gloves off,<br>
And a meek gentle bow he performed, while my anger was rapidly rising,<br>
“Who are you?” I angrily cried, and with hand on his heart as he bowed low,<br>
In the gentlest of termes he replied, “Your servant, Sir Pokurranshuvvle.”<br>
Didn’t I just ring the bell, “Here, Tom, Dick, George, Andrew!” I bawled out,<br>
“Come here! show this stranger the door!” My summons they heard and they did it:<br>
Soon to the door was he guided; once more he turned to me and bowed low,<br>
And so, with his hand on his heart, with all possible meekness departed.
