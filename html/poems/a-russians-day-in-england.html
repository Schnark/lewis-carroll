<div class="verse">
<p>Lunch at one (that’s “adîn”)<br>
As there’s lots to be seen.<br>
At two (which is “dvâ”)<br>
We set out on the car.<br>
Three o’clock (that is “trî”)<br>
Found me tired as could be<br>
And by four (that’s “chetîrî”)<br>
I felt terribly dreary:<br>
So when five struck (that’s “pyât”)<br>
I was quite out of heart.<br>
At six (that is “shaist”)<br>
I sighed “Oh for the <i>far</i> East!”<br>
At seven (called “sêm”)<br>
Home to dinner we came.<br>
At eight (that is “vosem”)<br>
Called the children, to dose ’em.<br>
Supped at nine (that is “dyasat”)<br>
Which I made a long face at.</p>

<p>Finis.</p>

<p>Now, if it’s any<br>
Advantage to Lady Gwendolen Cecil<br>
To remember how Russ<br>
Is accented by <i>us</i>,<br>
Let her read, at odd times,<br>
These Russ-Anglican rhymes.
