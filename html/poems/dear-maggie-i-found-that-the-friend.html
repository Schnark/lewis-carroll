<h2>Dear Maggie,—I found that the friend</h2>

<div class="verse">
<p>Dear Maggie,—I found that the <i>friend</i>,<br>
that the little girl asked me to write to,<br>
lived at Ripon, and not at Land’s End—<br>
a nice sort of place to invite to!<br>
It looked rather suspicious to me—<br>
and soon after, by dint of incessant<br>
inquiries, I found out that <i>she</i><br>
was called Maggie, and lived in a Crescent!<br>
Of course I declared, “After that”<br>
(the language I used doesn’t matter),<br>
“I will <i>not</i> address her, that’s flat!<br>
So do not expect me to flatter.”</p>

<p>Well, I hope you will soon see<br>
your beloved Pa come back—<br>
for consider, should you be<br>
quite content with only Jack?<br>
Just suppose they made a blunder!<br>
(Such things happen now and then.)<br>
Really, now, I shouldn’t wonder<br>
if your “John” came home again,<br>
and your father stayed at school!<br>
A most awkward thing, no doubt.<br>
How would you receive him? You’ll<br>
say, perhaps, “you’d turn him out.”<br>
That would answer well, so far<br>
as concerns the boy, you know—<br>
but consider your Papa,<br>
learning lessons in a row<br>
of great inky schoolboys! This<br>
(though unlikely) might occur:<br>
“Haly” would be grieved to miss<br>
him (don’t mention it to <i>her</i>).</p>

</figure>

<p>No <i>carte</i> has yet been done of me,<br>
that does real justice to my <i>smile</i>;<br>
and so I hardly like, you see,<br>
to send you one. However, I’ll<br>
consider if I will or not—<br>
meanwhile, I send a little thing<br>
to give you an idea of what<br>
I look like when I’m lecturing.<br>
The merest sketch, you will allow—<br>
yet still I think there’s something grand<br>
in the expression of the brow<br>
and in the action of the hand.</p>

<p>Have you read <a href="../magazines/brunos-revenge.html">my fairy tale<br>
in <i>Aunt Judy’s Magazine</i>?</a><br>
If you have you will not fail<br>
to discover what I mean<br>
when I say “Bruno yesterday came<br>
to remind me that <i>he</i> was my god-son!”—<br>
on the ground that I “gave him a name”!</p>

<p>Your affectionate friend, C. L. Dodgson.</p>

<p>P.S.—I would send, if I were not too shy,<br>
the same message to “Haly” that she<br>
(though I do not deserve it, not I!)<br>
has sent through her sister to me.<br>
My best love to yourself—to your Mother<br>
my kindest regards—to your small,<br>
fat, impertinent, ignorant brother<br>
my hatred. I think that is all.
