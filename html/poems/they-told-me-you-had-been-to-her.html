<div class="verse">
<p>They told me you had been to her,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And mentioned me to him:<br>
She gave me a good character,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>But said I could not swim.</p>

<p>He sent them word I had not gone<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(We know it to be true):<br>
If she should push the matter on,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>What would become of you?</p>

<p>I gave her one, they gave him two,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>You gave us three or more;<br>
They all returned from him to you,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Though they were mine before.</p>

<p>If I or she should chance to be<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Involved in this affair,<br>
He trusts to you to set them free,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Exactly as we were.</p>

<p>My notion was that you had been<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(Before she had this fit)<br>
An obstacle that came between<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Him, and ourselves, and it.</p>

<p>Don’t let him know she liked them best,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>For this must ever be<br>
A secret, kept from all the rest,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Between yourself and me.
