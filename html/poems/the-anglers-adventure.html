<div class="verse">
<p>As I was ling’ring by the river’s stream<br>
Striving to lure the shoals of glitt’ring fish<br>
With hook and line, methought I had a dream,<br>
That what I caught was placed upon a dish.</p>

<p>No tail it had, it could not be a beast,<br>
No wings, it could by no means be a bird.<br>
Its flesh, when tasted, proved a luscious feast,<br>
And yet, methought, its name I’d never heard.</p>

<p>Speckles it had of most enchanting hue,<br>
An unknown foreign creature it appeared;<br>
It might be anything, perhaps a Jew,<br>
I almost wondered it had not a beard.</p>

<p>While thus I slept and dreamed, I felt a twitch<br>
Which almost pulled my fishing rod away,<br>
I started to my feet. Oh! what a rich<br>
Vision of splendour in the water lay!</p>

<p>The creature of my dreams! most wonderful,<br>
Struggling most violently on the hook,<br>
I landed it with one most desperate pull,<br>
Ere that I ventured on its form to look.</p>

<p>In every item it did correspond<br>
Exactly with what I in sleep had seen,<br>
It seemed in fact almost to go beyond<br>
The former in the grandeur of its mean.</p>

<p>I scarce could fancy that there did exist<br>
A creature which in beauty so surpassed.<br>
I pondered o’er each fish and bird and beast,<br>
And puzzled out its name, I thought, at last.</p>

<p>By thinking over Buffon’s history,<br>
And Bewick’s Birds, and Isaak Walton’s book,<br>
I seemed to penetrate the mystery,<br>
The name of that which hung upon my hook.</p>

<p>Remembering Isaak Walton’s own instructions<br>
And other anglers’ who have gone before us,<br>
By algebra, and eke the help of fluxions,<br>
I made it out, it was a Plesiosaurus!</p>

<p>“Is it not so?” I said unto my maid,<br>
She wrung her hands as through the room she strode,<br>
“Take it away! Oh master mine,” she said,<br>
“It is, it is, it is, it is a toad!!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>Moral: “Don’t dream.”
