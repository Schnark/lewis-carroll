<div class="verse">
<p>In winter, when the fields are white,<br>
I sing this song for your delight—</p>

<p>In spring, when woods are getting green,<br>
I’ll try and tell you what I mean:</p>

<p>In summer, when the days are long,<br>
Perhaps you’ll understand the song:</p>

<p>In autumn, when the leaves are brown,<br>
Take pen and ink, and write it down.</p>

<p>I sent a message to the fish:<br>
I told them “This is what I wish.”</p>

<p>The little fishes of the sea,<br>
They sent an answer back to me.</p>

<p>The little fishes’ answer was<br>
“We cannot do it, Sir, because——”</p>

<p>I sent to them again to say<br>

“The little fishes are in bed.”</p>

<p>I said to him, I said it plain,<br>
“Then you must wake them up again.”</p>

<p>I said it very loud and clear:<br>
I went and shouted in his ear.</p>

<p>But he was very stiff and proud:<br>
He said “You needn’t shout so loud!”</p>

<p>And he was very proud and stiff:<br>
He said “I’d go and wake them, if——”</p>

<p>I took a corkscrew from the shelf:<br>
I went to wake them up myself.</p>

<p>And when I found the door was locked,<br>
I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.</p>

<p>And when I found the door was shut,<br>
I tried to turn the handle, but——
