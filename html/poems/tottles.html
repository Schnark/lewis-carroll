<div class="verse">
<p>“One thousand pounds per annuum<br>
Is not so bad a figure, come!”<br>
Cried Tottles. “And I tell you, flat,<br>
A man may marry well on that!<br>
To say ‘the Husband needs the Wife’<br>
Is <i>not</i> the way to represent it.<br>
The crowning joy of Woman’s life<br>
Is <i>Man</i>!” said Tottles (and he meant it).</p>

<p>The blissful Honey-moon is past:<br>
The Pair have settled down at last:<br>
Mamma-in-law their home will share,<br>
And make their happiness her care.<br>
“Your income is an ample one;<br>
Go it, my children!” (And they went it).<br>
“I <i>rayther</i> think this kind of fun<br>
Won’t last!” said Tottles (and he meant it).</p>

<p>They took a little country-box—<br>
A box at Covent Garden also:<br>
They lived a life of double-knocks,<br>
Acquaintances began to call so:<br>
Their London house was much the same<br>
(It took three hundred, clear, to rent it):<br>
“Life is a very jolly game!”<br>
Cried happy Tottles (and he meant it).</p>

<p>‘Contented with a frugal lot’<br>
(He always used that phrase at Gunter’s),<br>
He bought a handy little yacht—<br>
A dozen serviceable hunters—<br>
The fishing of a Highland Loch—<br>
A sailing-boat to circumvent it—<br>
“The sounding of that Gaelic ‘och’<br>
Beats <i>me</i>!” said Tottles (and he meant it).</p>

<p>But oh, the worst of human ills<br>
(Poor Tottles found) are ‘little bills’!<br>
And, with no balance in the Bank,<br>
What wonder that his spirits sank?<br>
Still, as the money flowed away,<br>
He wondered how on earth she spent it.<br>
“You cost me twenty pounds a day,<br>
<i>At least</i>!” cried Tottles (and he meant it).</p>

<p>She sighed. “Those Drawing Rooms, you know!<br>
I really never thought about it:<br>
Mamma declared we ought to go—<br>
We should be Nobodies without it.<br>
That diamond-circlet for my brow—<br>
I quite believed that <i>she</i> had sent it,<br>
Until the Bill came in just now——”<br>
“<i>Viper</i>!” cried Tottles (and he meant it).</p>

<p>Poor Mrs.&nbsp;T. could bear no more,<br>
But fainted flat upon the floor.<br>
Mamma-in-law, with anguish wild,<br>
Seeks, all in vain, to rouse her child.<br>
“Quick! Take this box of smelling-salts!<br>
Don’t scold her, James, or you’ll repent it,<br>
She’s a <i>dear</i> girl, with all her faults——”<br>
“She <i>is</i>!” groaned Tottles (and he meant it).</p>

<p>“I was a donkey,” Tottles cried,<br>
“To choose your daughter for my bride!<br>
’Twas <i>you</i> that bid us cut a dash!<br>
’Tis <i>you</i> have brought us to this smash!<br>
You don’t suggest one single thing<br>
That can in any way prevent it——<br>
Then what’s the use of arguing?<br>
<i>Shut up!</i>” cried Tottles (and he meant it).</p>

<p>“And, now the mischief’s done, perhaps<br>
You’ll kindly go and pack your traps?<br>
Since <i>two</i> (your daughter and your son)<br>
Are Company, but <i>three</i> are none.<br>
A course of saving we’ll begin:<br>
When change is needed, <i>I’ll</i> invent it:<br>
Don’t think to put <i>your</i> finger in<br>
<i>This</i> pie!” cried Tottles (and he meant it).</p>

<p>See now this couple settled down<br>
In quiet lodgings, out of town:<br>
Submissively the tearful wife<br>
Accepts a plain and humble life:<br>
Yet begs one boon on bended knee:<br>
‘My ducky-darling, don’t resent it!<br>
Mamma might come for two or three——’<br>
‘NEVER!’ yelled Tottles. And he meant it.
