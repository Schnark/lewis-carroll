<p><i>Curtain rises and discovers the Speaker, who comes forward, thinking aloud,</i></p>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen” seems stiff and cold.<br>
There’s something personal in “Young and Old”;<br>
I’ll try “Dear Friends” (<i>addresses audience</i>) Oh! let me call you so.<br>
Dear friends, look kindly on our little show.<br>
Contrast us not with giants in the Art,<br>
Nor say “You should see Sothern in that part”;<br>
Nor yet, <span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-1">unkindest cut of all,</span> in fact,<br>
Condemn the actors, while you praise the Act.<br>
Having by coming proved you find a charm in it,<br>
Don’t go away, and hint there may be harm in it.</p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-1"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>Julius Caesar</i> by William Shakespeare</aside>

<hr class="stars">

<p><i>Miss Crabb</i>: My dear Miss Verjuice, can it really be?<br>
You’re just in time, love, for a cup of tea;<br>
And so, you went to see those people play.</p>

<p><i>Miss Verjuice</i>: Well! yes, Miss Crabb, and I may truly say<br>
You showed your wisdom when you stayed <i>away</i>.</p>

<p><i>Miss C.</i>: Doubtless! Theatricals in <i>our</i> quiet town!<br>
I’ve always said, “The law should put them down,”<br>
They mean no harm, tho’ I begin to doubt it—<br>
But now sit down and tell me all about it.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i>: Well then, Miss Crabb, I won’t deceive you, dear;<br>
I heard some things I—didn’t like to hear:</p>

<p><i>Miss C.</i>: But don’t omit them now.</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i>: <span class="after-hfill">Well! No! I’ll try</span><br>
To tell you <i>all</i> the painful history.</p>

<p>(<i>They whisper alternately behind a small fan.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Miss V.</i>: And then, my dear, Miss Asterisk and he<br>
Pretended they were lovers!!</p>

<p><i>Miss C.</i>: <span class="after-hfill">Gracious me!!</span></p>

<p>(<i>More whispering behind fan.</i>)</p>

<hr class="stars">

<p><i>Speaker</i>: What! <i>Acting</i> love!! And has that ne’er been seen<br>
Save with a row of footlights placed between?<br>
My gentle censors, let me roundly ask,<br>
Do none but actors ever wear a mask?<br>
Or have we reached at last that golden age<br>
That finds deception only on the Stage?<br>
Come, let’s confess all round before we budge,<br>
When all are guilty, none should play the Judge.<br>
We’re actors all, a motley company,<br>
Some on the Stage, and others—on the sly—<br>
And guiltiest he who paints so well his phiz<br>
His brother actors scarce know what he is.<br>
A truce to moralizing; we invite<br>
The goodly company we see to-night<br>
To have the little banquet we have got,<br>
Well dressed, we hope, and served up <i>hot &amp; hot</i>.<br>
“Loan of a Lover” is the leading dish,<br>
Concluding with a dainty course of fish;<br>
“Whitebait at Greenwich” in the best condition<br>
(By Mr.&nbsp;Gladstone’s very kind permission).<br>
Before the courses will be handed round<br>
An <i>Entrée</i> made of Children, nicely browned.</p>

<p><span class="after-hfill"><i>Bell rings.</i></span></p>

<p>But hark! The bell to summon me away;<br>
They’re anxious to begin their little Play.<br>
One word before I go—We’ll do our best,<br>
And crave your kind indulgence for the rest;<br>
Own that at least we’ve striven to succeed,<br>
And take the good intention for the deed.
