<article>

<div class="verse">
<p>The sun was shining on the sea,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Shining with all his might:<br>
He did his very best to make<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The billows smooth and bright—<br>
And this was odd, because it was<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The middle of the night.</p>

<p>The moon was shining sulkily,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Because she thought the sun<br>
Had got no business to be there<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>After the day was done—<br>
“It’s very rude of him,” she said,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“To come and spoil the fun!”</p>

<p>The sea was wet as wet could be,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The sands were dry as dry.<br>
You could not see a cloud, because<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>No cloud was in the sky:<br>
No birds were flying overhead—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>There were no birds to fly.</p>

<p>The Walrus and the Carpenter<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Were walking close at hand;<br>
They wept like anything to see<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Such quantities of sand:<br>
“If this were only cleared away,”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They said, “it <i>would</i> be grand!”</p>

<p>“If seven maids with seven mops<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Swept it for half a year,<br>
Do you suppose,” the Walrus said,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“That they could get it clear?”<br>
“I doubt it,” said the Carpenter,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And shed a bitter tear.</p>

<p>“O Oysters, come and walk with us!”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The Walrus did beseech.<br>
“A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Along the briny beach:<br>
We cannot do with more than four,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>To give a hand to each.”</p>

<p>The eldest Oyster looked at him.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>But never a word he said:<br>
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And shook his heavy head—<br>
Meaning to say he did not choose<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>To leave the oyster-bed.</p>

<p>But four young oysters hurried up,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>All eager for the treat:<br>
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Their shoes were clean and neat—<br>
And this was odd, because, you know,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They hadn’t any feet.</p>

<p>Four other Oysters followed them,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And yet another four;<br>
And thick and fast they came at last,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And more, and more, and more—<br>
All hopping through the frothy waves,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And scrambling to the shore.</p>

<p>The Walrus and the Carpenter<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Walked on a mile or so,<br>
And then they rested on a rock<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Conveniently low:<br>
And all the little Oysters stood<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And waited in a row.</p>

<p>“The time has come,” the Walrus said,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“To talk of many things:<br>
Of shoes—and ships—and sealing-wax—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Of cabbages—and kings—<br>
And why the sea is boiling hot—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And whether pigs have wings.”</p>

<p>“But wait a bit,” the Oysters cried,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Before we have our chat;<br>
For some of us are out of breath,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And all of us are fat!”<br>
“No hurry!” said the Carpenter.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They thanked him much for that.</p>

<p>“A loaf of bread,” the Walrus said,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Is what we chiefly need:<br>
Pepper and vinegar besides<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Are very good indeed—<br>
Now if you’re ready Oysters dear,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>We can begin to feed.”</p>

<p>“But not on us!” the Oysters cried,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Turning a little blue,<br>
“After such kindness, that would be<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A dismal thing to do!”<br>
“The night is fine,” the Walrus said<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Do you admire the view?”</p>

<p>“It was so kind of you to come!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And you are very nice!”<br>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Cut us another slice:<br>
I wish you were not quite so deaf—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>I’ve had to ask you twice!”</p>

<p>“It seems a shame,” the Walrus said,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“To play them such a trick,<br>
After we’ve brought them out so far,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And made them trot so quick!”<br>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“The butter’s spread too thick!”</p>

<p>“I weep for you,” the Walrus said.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“I deeply sympathize.”<br>
With sobs and tears he sorted out<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Those of the largest size.<br>
Holding his pocket-handkerchief<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Before his streaming eyes.</p>

<p>“O Oysters,” said the Carpenter.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“You’ve had a pleasant run!<br>
Shall we be trotting home again?”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>But answer came there none—<br>
And that was scarcely odd, because<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-1">They’d eaten every one.</span>
</p>
<aside class="toggle variant wide" id="annotation-1"><p>For H. Savile Clarke’s dramatization Carroll added an additional verse and some more content:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>The Carpenter he ceased to sob;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The Walrus ceased to weep;<br>
They’d finished all the oysters;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And they laid them down to sleep—<br>
And of their craft and cruelty<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>The punishment to reap.
</p><hr class="bigskip">

<p>The Carpenter is sleeping, the butter’s on his face,<br>
The vinegar and pepper are all about the place!<br>
Let oysters rock your cradle and lull you into rest;<br>
And if that will not do it, we’ll sit upon your chest!<br>
We’ll sit upon your chest!<br>
We’ll sit upon your chest!<br>
The simplest way to do it is to sit upon your chest!</p>

<p>O woeful, weeping Walrus, your tears are all a sham!<br>
You’re greedier for Oysters than children are for jam.<br>
You like to have an Oyster to give the meal a zest—<br>
Excuse me, wicked Walrus, far stamping on your chest!<br>
For stamping on your chest!<br>
For stamping on your chest!<br>
Excuse me, wicked Walrus, for stamping on your chest!
