<div class="verse">
<p>The Khalif Emir sat upon his throne,<br>
He ravaged all the land till he was left alone.<br>
The Brahmin Mufti came his throne before,<br>
He told a tale all full of learned lore;<br>
“An ancient owl he sat upon a tree,<br>
A younger owl, and he would married be,<br>
He asked him for a boon and dowry fair,<br>
Since he to all his property was heir.<br>
He said, ‘My son, I have it not to give<br>
But if one year our khalif he should live,<br>
I’ll give you, dearest duck, as sure as fate<br>
One hundred farms all waste and desolate.’”<br>
He ceased his tale: he gazed upon his face,<br>
He saw his tears come trickling down apace,<br>
He thought upon it for an hour or more,<br>
He did what he had never done before,<br>
He changed his conduct, he the people bless’d<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(No more he made them weep)<br>
And the land was steeped in happiness<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(Full eighteen inches deep.)</p>

<p>Moral: “Change your conduct.”
