<h3>I</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>There was an old farmer of Readall,<br>
Who made holes in his face with a needle,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span> They went <i>far</i> deeper in<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span> Than to pierce through the skin,<br>
And yet strange to say he was made beadle.
</p></div>

<h3>II</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>There was an eccentric old draper,<br>
Who wore a hat made of brown paper,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span> It went up to a point,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span> Yet it looked out of joint,<br>
The cause of which <i>he</i> said was “vapour.”
</p></div>

<h3>III</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>There was once a young man of Oporta,<br>
Who daily got shorter and shorter,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span> The reason he said<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span> Was the hod on his head,<br>
Which was filled with the <i>heaviest</i> mortar.</p>

<p>His sister, named Lucy O’Finner,<br>
Grew constantly thinner and thinner;<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span> The reason was plain,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span> She slept out in the rain,<br>
And was never allowed any dinner.
