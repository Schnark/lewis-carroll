<p><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-1">These consist of two Double Acrostics and two Charades.</span></p>

<p><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-1">No.&nbsp;I. was written at the request of some young friends, who had gone to a ball at an Oxford Commemoration—and also as a specimen of what might be done by making the Double Acrostic a connected poem instead of what it has hitherto been, a string of disjointed stanzas, on every conceivable subject, and about as interesting to read straight through as a page of a Cyclopædia. The first two stanzas describe the two main words, and each subsequent stanza one of the cross “lights.”</span></p>
<aside class="toggle variant wide" id="annotation-1"><p>Introduction in <i>Phantasmagoria</i>:</p>

<p>The Double Acrostic, a form of puzzle which has lately become fashionable, is constructed thus:—Two words are selected having the same number of letters: these are supposed to be written in two parallel columns, and a series of words is then found (their length is immaterial) such that the first column may consist of their initial letters, and the second of their final letters. For instance, if the column-words selected were ‘rose’ and ‘ring,’ we might fill up thus:—</p><div class="continue"><table class="">
<tr><td>r</td><td>i</td><td>v</td><td>e</td><td>r</td></tr>
<tr><td>o</td><td></td><td>b</td><td></td><td>i</td></tr>
<tr><td>s</td><td>e</td><td>v</td><td>e</td><td>n</td></tr>
<tr><td>e</td><td></td><td>g</td><td></td><td>g</td></tr>
</table></div><p class="continue"> The two column-words, and the horizontal words, are then described in a series of lines or verses, and the puzzle is complete.</p>

<p>The innumerable specimens of this form of puzzle already published are in every way (if we except the studied insipidity of the separate verses, and their total want of connexion one with another) to be commended. The following attempt, made at the request of some friends who had gone to a ball at an Oxford Commemoration, is printed in the hope of suggesting a possible improvement in the treatment of the subject.
</p></aside>

<div class="verse">
<p>There was an ancient City, stricken down<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>With a strange frenzy, and for many a day<br>
They paced from morn to eve the <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-2">crowded</span> town,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>And danced the night away.</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-2">noisy</aside>

<p>I asked the cause: the aged man grew sad:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>They pointed to a building gray and tall,<br>
And hoarsely answered “Step inside, my lad,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>And then you’ll see it all.”</p>

<p>Yet what are all such gaieties to me<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Whose thoughts are full of indices and surds?<br>
<math><mrow><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>7</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>53</mn></mrow></math><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span><math><mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>11</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></mrow></math>.</p>

<p>But something whispered “It will soon be done:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Bands cannot always play, nor ladies smile:<br>
Endure with patience the distasteful fun<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>For just a little while!”</p>

<p>A change came o’er my Vision—it was night:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>We clove a pathway through a frantic throng:<br>
The steeds, wild-plunging, filled us with affright:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>The chariots whirled along.</p>

<p>Within a marble hall a river ran—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A living tide, half muslin and half cloth:<br>
And here one mourned a broken wreath or fan,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>Yet swallowed down her wrath;</p>

<p>And here one offered to a thirsty fair<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>(His words half-drowned amid those thunders tuneful)<br>
Some frozen viand (there were many there),<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>A tooth-ache in each spoonful.</p>

<p>There comes a happy pause, for human strength<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Will not endure to dance without cessation;<br>
And every one must reach the point at length<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>Of absolute prostration.</p>

<p>At such a moment ladies learn to give,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>To partners who would urge them over-much,<br>
A flat and yet decided negative—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>Photographers love such.</p>

<p>There comes a welcome summons—hope revives,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And fading eyes grow bright, and pulses quicken:<br>
Incessant pop the corks, and busy knives<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>Dispense the tongue and chicken.</p>

<p>Flushed with new life, the crowd flows back again:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And all is tangled talk and mazy motion—<br>
Much like a waving field of golden grain,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>Or a tempestuous ocean.</p>

<p>And thus they give the time, that Nature meant<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>For peaceful sleep and meditative snores,<br>
To <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-3">ceaseless</span> din and mindless merriment<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>And waste of shoes and floors.</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-3">thoughtless</aside>

<p>And One (we name him not) that flies the flowers,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That dreads the dances, and that shuns the salads,<br>
They doom to pass in solitude the hours,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>Writing acrostic-ballads.</p>

<p>How late it grows! <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-4">The hour is surely</span> past<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>That should have warned us with its double-knock?<br>
The twilight wanes, and morning comes at last—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>“Oh, Uncle, what’s o’clock?”</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-4">Long since the hour is</aside>

<p>The Uncle gravely nods, and wisely winks.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It <i>may</i> mean much, but how is one to know?<br>
He opes his mouth—yet out of it, methinks,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>No words of wisdom flow.
