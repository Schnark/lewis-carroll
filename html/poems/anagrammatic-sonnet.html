<p>[M]y “Anagrammatic Sonnet” will be new to you. Each line has 4&nbsp;feet, and each foot is an anagram, i.&thinsp;e., the letters of it can be re-arranged so as to make one word. Thus there are 24&nbsp;anagrams, which will occupy your leisure moments for some time, I hope. Remember, I don’t limit myself to substantives, as some do. I should consider “we dish = wished” a fair anagram.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>As to the war, try elm. I tried.<br>
The wig cast in, I went to ride.<br>
“Ring? Yes.” We rang. “Let’s rap.” We don’t.<br>
“O shew her wit!” As yet she won’t.<br>
Saw eel in Rome. Dry one: he’s wet.<br>
I am dry. O forge! Th’rogue! Why a net?
</p></div>

<p>To these you may add “abcdefgi,” which makes a compound word—as good a word as “summer-house.”</p>
