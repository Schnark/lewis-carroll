<p>2. That at the expiration of such time the Curators be authorised to make Cricket-grounds, and allot them to Cricket-clubs or Colleges from which applications have been received, according to priority of application.

<div class="verse">
<p>Museum! loveliest building of the plain<br>
Where Cherwell winds towards the distant main;<br>
How often have I loitered o’er thy green,<br>
Where humble happiness endeared the scene!<br>
How often have I paused on every charm,<br>
The rustic couple walking arm in arm—<br>
The <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-3">groups</span> of trees, with seats beneath the shade<br>
For prattling babes and whisp’ring lovers made—<br>
The never-failing brawl, the busy mill<br>
Where tiny urchins vied in fistic skill—<br>
(Two phrases only have that dusky race<br>
Caught from the learned influence of the place;<br>
Phrases in their simplicity sublime,<br>
‘Scramble a copper!’ ‘Please, Sir, what’s the time?’)<br>
These round thy walks their cheerful influence shed;<br>
These were thy charms—but all these charms are fled.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Amidst thy bowers the tyrant’s hand is seen,<br>
And rude pavilions sadden all thy green;<br>
One selfish pastime grasps the whole domain,<br>
And half a faction swallows up the plain;<br>
Adown thy glades, all sacrificed to cricket,<br>
The hollow-sounding bat now guards the wicket;<br>
Sunk are thy mounds in shapeless level all,<br>
Lest aught impede the swiftly rolling ball;<br>
And trembling, shrinking from the fatal blow,<br>
Far, far away thy hapless children go.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Ill fares the place, to luxury a prey.<br>
Where wealth accumulates, and minds decay;<br>
Athletic sports may flourish or may fade.<br>
Fashion may make them, even as it has made;<br>
But the broad Parks, the city’s joy and pride,<br>
When once destroyed can never be supplied!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen, who survey<br>
The rich man’s joys increase, the poor’s decay,<br>
’Tis yours to judge, how wide the limits stand<br>
Between a splendid and a happy land.<br>
Proud swells go by with laugh of hollow joy.<br>
And shouting Folly hails them with ‘Ahoy!’<br>
Funds even beyond the miser’s wish abound,<br>
And rich men flock from all the world around.<br>
Yet count our gains. This wealth is but a name,<br>
That leaves our useful products still the same.<br>
Not so the loss. The man of wealth and pride<br>
Takes up a space that many poor supplied;<br>
Space for the game, and all its instruments,<br>
Space for pavilions and for scorers’ tents;<br>
The ball, that raps his shins in padding cased,<br>
Has worn the verdure to an arid waste;<br>
His Park, where these exclusive sports are seen,<br>
Indignant spurns the rustic from the green;<br>
While through the plain, consigned to silence all,<br>
In barren splendour flits the russet ball.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>In peaceful converse with his brother Don,<br>
Here oft the calm Professor wandered on;<br>
Strange words he used—men drank with wondering ears<br>
The languages called ‘dead,’ the tongues of other years.<br>
(Enough of Heber! Let me once again<br>
Attune my verse to Goldsmith’s liquid strain.)<br>
A man he was to undergraduates dear.<br>
And passing rich with forty pounds a year.<br>
And so, I ween, he would have been till now,<br>
Had not his friends (’twere long to tell you how)<br>
Prevailed on him, Jack-Horner-like, to try<br>
Some method to evaluate his pie,<br>
And win from those dark depths, with skilful thumb,<br>
Five times a hundredweight of luscious plum—<br>
Yet for no thirst of wealth, no love of praise,<br>
In learned labour he consumed his days!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>O luxury! thou cursed by Heaven’s decree.<br>
How ill exchanged are things like these for thee!<br>
How do thy potions, with insidious joy,<br>
Diffuse their pleasures only to destroy;<br>
Iced cobbler, Badminton, and shandy-gaff,<br>
Rouse the loud jest and idiotic laugh;<br>
Inspired by them, to tipsy greatness grown.<br>
Men boast a florid vigour not their own;<br>
At every draught more wild and wild they grow;<br>
While pitying friends observe ‘I told you so!’<br>
Till, summoned to their post, at the first ball,<br>
A feeble under-hand, their wickets fall.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Even now the devastation is begun.<br>
And half the business of destruction done;<br>
Even now, methinks while pondering here in pity,<br>
I see the rural Virtues leave the city.<br>
Contented Toil, and calm scholastic Care,<br>
And frugal Moderation, all are there;<br>
Resolute Industry that scorns the lure<br>
Of careless mirth—that dwells apart secure—<br>
To science gives her days, her midnight oil,<br>
Cheered by the sympathy of others’ toil—<br>
Courtly Refinement, and that Taste in dress<br>
That brooks no meanness, yet avoids excess—<br>
All these I see, with slow reluctant pace<br>
Desert the long-beloved and honoured place!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>While yet ’tis time, Oxonia, rise and fling<br>
The spoiler from thee: grant no parleying!<br>
Teach him that eloquence, against the wrong,<br>
Though very poor, may still be very strong;<br>
That party-interests we must forego,<br>
When hostile to ‘pro bono publico’;<br>
That faction’s empire hastens to its end,<br>
When once mankind to common sense attend;<br>
While independent votes may win the day<br>
Even against the potent spell of ‘Play!’
