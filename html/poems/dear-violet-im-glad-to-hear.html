<p>Dear Violet,—I’m glad to hear<br>
you children like the Magazine<br>
I ordered for you for a year:<br>
and if you happen to have seen<br>
the book about “Lord Fauntleroy,”<br>
you’ll find an interesting bit<br>
about the child that acts the Boy<br>
(now they have made a Play of it)<br>
in Number Six. She seems to be<br>
a child without one bit of pride:<br>
a pretty name too, hasn’t she?<br>
the little “Elsie Leslie Lyde.”</p>

<p>I grieve to hear your bantam-hen<br>
is fond of rolling eggs away.<br>
You should remind it, now and then,<br>
of “Waste not, want not.” You should say<br>
“a bantam-hen, that wastes an egg,<br>
is sure to get extremely poor,<br>
and to be forced at last to beg<br>
for hard-boiled eggs, from door to door.<br>
How would you like it, Bantam-hen,”<br>
you should go on, “if all your brood<br>
were hard-boiled chickens? You would then<br>
be sorry you had been so rude!”<br>
Tell it all this, and don’t forget!<br>
And now I think it’s time for me<br>
to sign myself, dear Violet,</p>

<p>Your loving Uncle, C. L. D.
