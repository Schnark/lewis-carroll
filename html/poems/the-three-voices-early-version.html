<h3>The First Voice</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>With hands tight clenched through matted hair,<br>
He crouched in trance of dumb despair:<br>
There came a breeze from out the air.</p>

<p>It passed athwart the glooming flat—<br>
It fanned his forehead as he sat—<br>
It lightly bore away his hat,</p>

<p>All to the feet of one who stood<br>
Like maid enchanted in a wood,<br>
Frowning as darkly as she could.</p>

<p>With huge umbrella, lank and brown,<br>
Unerringly she pinned it down,<br>
Right through the centre of the crown.</p>

<p>Then, with an aspect cold and grim,<br>
Regardless of its battered <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-1">rim,</span><br>
She took it up and gave it him.</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-1">“brim” in <i>Mischmasch</i></aside>

<p>Awhile like one in dreams he stood,<br>
Then faltered forth his gratitude,<br>
In words just short of being rude:</p>

<p>For it had lost its shape and shine,<br>
And it had cost him four-and-nine,<br>
And he was going out to dine.</p>

<p>With grave indifference to his speech,<br>
Fixing her eyes upon the beach,<br>
She said “Each gives to more than each.”</p>

<p><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-2">He could not answer yea or nay;</span><br>
He faltered “Gifts may pass away.”<br>
Yet knew not what he meant to say.</p>
<aside class="toggle variant wide" id="annotation-2"><p>In earlier versions, this verse is:
</p><div class="continue"><div class="verse">
<p>He raised his eyes in sudden awe,<br>
And stammered out “Thy wish is law!”<br>
Yet knew not what he said it for.
</p></div></div></aside>

<p>“If that be so,” she staight replied,<br>
“Each heart with each doth coincide.<br>
What boots it? For the world is wide.”</p>

<p>And he, not wishing to appear<br>
Less wise, said “This Material Sphere<br>
Is but Attributive Idea.”</p>

<p>But when she asked him “Wherefore so?”<br>
He felt his very whiskers glow,<br>
And frankly owned “I do not know.”</p>

<p>While, like broad waves of golden grain,<br>
Or sunlit hues on cloistered pane,<br>
His colour came and went again.</p>

<p>Pitying his obvious distress,<br>
Yet with a tinge of bitterness,<br>
She said “The More exceeds the Less.”</p>

<p>“A truth of such undoubted weight,”<br>
He urged, “and so extreme in date,<br>
It were superfluous to state.”</p>

<p>Roused into sudden passion, she<br>
In tone of <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-3">cold</span> malignity:<br>
“To others, yes; but not to thee.”</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-3">stern</aside>

<p><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-4">But when she saw him quail and quake,</span><br>
And when he urged “For pity’s sake!”<br>
Once more in gentle tone she spake:</p>
<aside class="toggle variant wide" id="annotation-4"><p>In earlier versions, this verse is:
</p><div class="continue"><div class="verse">
<p>Then proudly folded arm in arm:<br>
But when he urged, “I meant no harm,”<br>
Once more her speech grew mild and calm:
</p></div></div></aside>

<p>“Thought in the mind doth still abide;<br>
That is by Intellect supplied,<br>
And within that Idea doth hide.</p>

<p>“<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-5">And he, that yearns the truth to know,</span><br>
Still further inwardly may go,<br>
And find Idea from Notion flow.</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-5">“He who doth yearn the Truth to know” in <i>Mischmasch</i></aside>

<p>“And thus the chain, that sages sought,<br>
Is to a glorious circle wrought,<br>
For Notion hath its source in Thought.”</p>

<p>When he, with racked and whirling brain,<br>
Feebly implored her to explain,<br>
She simply said it all again.</p>

<p>Wrenched with an agony intense,<br>
He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense,<br>
And careless of all consequence:</p>

<p>“Mind—I believe—is Essence—Ent—<br>
Abstract—that is—an Accident—<br>
Which we—that is to say—I meant—”</p>

<p><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-6">When, with quick breath and cheeks all flushed,</span><br>
<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-7">At length his speech was somewhat hushed,</span><br>
She looked at him, and he was crushed.</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-6">“Thus far he panted, wild and flushed” in <i>Mischmasch</i></aside>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-7">“But when his speech was somewhat hushed” in <i>Mischmasch</i></aside>

<p>It needed not her calm reply;<br>
<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-8">She fixed him with a stony eye,</span><br>
And he could neither fight nor fly,</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-8">She did the buisness with her eye</aside>

<p>While she dissected, word by word,<br>
His speech, half guessed at and half heard,<br>
As might a cat a little bird.</p>

<p>Then, having wholly overthrown<br>
His views, and stripped them to the bone,<br>
Proceeded to unfold her own.</p>

<p>So passed they on with even pace,<br>
Yet gradually one might trace<br>
A shadow growing on his face.
</p></div>

<h3>The Second Voice</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>They walked beside the wave-worn beach,<br>
Her tongue was very apt to teach,<br>
And now and then he did beseech</p>

<p>She would abate her dulcet tone,<br>
Because the talk was all her own,<br>
And he was dull as any drone.</p>

<p>She urged <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-9">“No cheese is made of chalk:”</span><br>
And ceaseless flowed her dreary talk,<br>
Tuned to the footfall of a walk.</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-9">No knife is like a fork</aside>

<p>Her voice was very full and rich,<br>
And, when at length she asked him “Which?”<br>
It mounted to its highest pitch.</p>

<p>He a bewildered answer gave,<br>
Drowned in the sullen moaning wave,<br>
Lost in the echoes of the cave.</p>

<p>He answered her he knew not what;<br>
Like shaft from bow at random shot:<br>
He spoke, but she regarded not.</p>

<p>She waited not for his reply,<br>
But with a downward leaden eye<br>
Went on as if he were not by.</p>

<p>Sound argument and grave defence,<br>
Strange questions raised on “Why?” and “Whence?”<br>
And weighted down with common sense.</p>

<p>“Shall Man be Man? And shall he miss<br>
Of other thoughts no thought but this,<br>
Harmonious dews of sober bliss?</p>

<p>“What boots it? Shall his fevered eye<br>
Through towering nothingness descry<br>
The grisly phantom hurry by?</p>

<p>“And hear dumb shrieks that fill the air;<br>
See mouths that gape, and eyes that stare<br>
And redden in the dusky glare?</p>

<p>“The meadows breathing amber light,<br>
The darkness toppling from the height,<br>
The feathery train of granite Night?</p>

<p>“Shall he, grown gray among his peers,<br>
Through the <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-10">thick</span> curtain of his tears<br>
Catch glimpses of his earlier years,</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-10">“dark” in <i>The Train</i></aside>

<p>“And hear the sounds he knew of yore,<br>
Old shufflings on the sanded floor,<br>
Old <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-11">knuckles tapping</span> at the door?</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-11">footsteps kicking</aside>

<p>“Yet still before him as he flies<br>
One pallid form shall ever rise,<br>
And, bodying forth in glassy eyes</p>

<p>“<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-12">The vision</span> of a vanished good,<br>
Low peering through the tangled wood,<br>
Shall freeze the current of his blood.”</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-12">A dim reflex</aside>

<p>Still from each fact, with skill uncouth<br>
And savage rapture, like a tooth<br>
She wrenched some slow reluctant truth.</p>

<p>Till, like a silent water-mill,<br>
When summer suns have dried the rill,<br>
She reached a full stop, and was still.</p>

<p>Dead calm succeeded to the fuss,<br>
As when the <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-13">loaded omnibus</span><br>
Has reached the railway terminus;</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-13">overladen bus</aside>

<p>When, for the tumult of the street,<br>
Is heard the engine’s stifled beat,<br>
The <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-14">velvet</span> tread of porters’ feet.</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-14">weary</aside>

<p>With glance that ever sought the ground,<br>
She moved her lips without a sound,<br>
And every now and then she frowned.</p>

<p>He gazed upon the sleeping sea,<br>
And joyed in its tranquillity,<br>
And in that silence dead, but she</p>

<p>To muse a little space did seem,<br>
Then, like the echo of a dream,<br>
Harped back upon her threadbare theme.</p>

<p>Still an attentive ear he lent,<br>
But could not fathom what she meant:<br>
She was not deep, nor eloquent.</p>

<p>He marked the ripple on the sand:<br>
The even swaying of her hand<br>
Was all that he could understand.</p>

<p>He left her, and he turned aside:<br>
He sat and watched the coming tide<br>
Across the shores so newly dried.</p>

<p>He wondered at the waters clear,<br>
The breeze that whispered in his ear,<br>
The billows heaving far and near;</p>

<p>And why he had so long preferred<br>
To hang upon her every word;<br>
“In truth,” he said, “it was absurd.”
</p></div>

<h3>The Third Voice</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>Not long this transport held its place:<br>
Within a little moment’s space<br>
Quick tears were raining down his face.</p>

<p>His heart stood still, aghast with fear;<br>
A wordless voice, nor far nor near,<br>
He seemed to hear and not to hear.</p>

<p>“Tears kindle not the doubtful spark:<br>
If so, why not? Of this remark<br>
The bearings are profoundly dark.”</p>

<p>“Her speech,” he said, “hath caused this pain;<br>
Easier I count it to explain<br>
The jargon of the howling main,</p>

<p>“Or, stretched beside some sedgy brook,<br>
To con, with inexpressive look,<br>
An unintelligible book.”</p>

<p>Low spake the voice within his head,<br>
In words imagined more than said,<br>
Soundless as ghost’s intended tread:</p>

<p>“If thou art duller than before,<br>
Why quittedst thou the voice of lore?<br>
Why not endure, expecting more?”</p>

<p>“Rather than that,” he groaned aghast,<br>
“I’d writhe in depths of cavern vast,<br>
Some loathly vampire’s rich repast.”</p>

<p>“’Twere hard,” it answered, “themes immense<br>
To coop within the narrow fence<br>
That rings <i>thy</i> scant intelligence.”</p>

<p>“Not so,” he urged, “nor once alone:<br>
But there was that within her tone<br>
Which chilled me to the very bone.</p>

<p>“Her style was anything but clear,<br>
And most unpleasantly severe;<br>
Her epithets were very queer.</p>

<p>“And yet, so grand were her replies,<br>
I could not choose but deem her wise;<br>
I did not dare to criticise;</p>

<p>“Nor did I leave her, till she went<br>
So deep in tangled argument<br>
That all my powers of thought were spent.”</p>

<p>A little whisper inly slid,<br>
“Yet truth is truth: you know you did—”<br>
A little wink beneath the lid.</p>

<p>And, sickened with excess of dread,<br>
Prone to the dust he bent his head,<br>
And lay like one three-quarters dead.</p>

<p>Forth went the whisper like a breeze;<br>
Left him amid the wondering trees,<br>
Left him by no means at his ease.</p>

<p>Once more he weltered in despair,<br>
With hands, through denser-matted hair,<br>
More tightly clenched than then they were.</p>

<p>When, bathed in dawn of living red,<br>
Majestic frowned the mountain head,<br>
“Tell me my fault,” was all he said.</p>

<p>When, at high noon, the blazing sky<br>
Scorched in his head each haggard eye,<br>
Then keenest rose his weary cry.</p>

<p>And when at eve <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-15">the</span> unpitying sun<br>
Smiled grimly on the solemn fun,<br>
“Alack,” he sighed, “what <i>have</i> I done?”</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-15">“th’” in <i>Mischmasch</i></aside>

<p>But saddest, darkest was the sight,<br>
When the cold grasp of leaden Night<br>
Dashed him to earth, and held him tight.</p>

<p>Tortured, unaided, and alone,<br>
Thunders were silence to his groan,<br>
Bagpipes sweet music to its tone:</p>

<p>“What? Ever thus, in dismal round,<br>
Shall Pain and Mystery profound<br>
Pursue me like a sleepless hound,</p>

<p>“With crimson-dashed and eager jaws,<br>
Me, still in ignorance of the cause,<br>
Unknowing what I broke of laws?”</p>

<p>The whisper to his ear did seem<br>
Like echoed flow of silent stream,<br>
Or shadow of forgotten dream;</p>

<p>The whisper trembling in the wind:<br>
“Her fate with thine was intertwined,”<br>
So spake it in his inner mind;</p>

<p>“Each orbed on each a baleful star,<br>
Each proved the other’s blight and bar,<br>
Each unto each were best, most far:</p>

<p>“Yea, each to each was worse than foe,<br>
Thou, a scared dullard, gibbering low,<br>
And she, an avalanche of woe.”
