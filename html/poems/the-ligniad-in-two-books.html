<h2>The Ligniad, in two Books</h2>

<article>

<h3>Book I</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>Of man in stature small yet deeds sublime,<br>
Who, even from his tender toothless years,<br>
Boldly essayed to swallow and digest<br>
Whole tomes of massive learning, ostrich-like,<br>
Sing, classic Muse! and speed my daring quill,<br>
Whiles that in language all too poor and weak<br>
For such high themes, I tremblingly recount<br>
To listening world’s an hero’s history.</p>

<p>Nursed in a cradle framed of Doric reeds,<br>
In a fly-leaf of Scapula enwrapped,<br>
Fed on black-broth (oh classic privilege!)<br>
Seasoned with Attic salt, the infant throve.<br>
Small taste had he for toys of infancy;<br>
The coral and the bells he put aside;<br>
But in his cradle would soliloquise,<br>
And hold high commune with his inner man<br>
In Greek Iambics, aptly modified.<br>
A smile sardonic wore he in his joy;<br>
And in his sorrow shed no mawkish tear;<br>
<span class="annotated quoted" data-ref="annotation-1"><span lang="grc">ώ̓μοι πεπληγμαι</span></span> was his only cry,<br>
And with much “smiting of the breast,” he wrestled,<br>
And would have rent his hair, but that he had none.</p>
<aside class="toggle quoted" id="annotation-1"><b>Quoted</b> from <i>Agamemnon</i> by Aeschylos</aside>

<p>A merry boy the infant hath become;<br>
He leaps and dances in the light of life,<br>
With his shrill laughter rings the ancient house,<br>
The stairs reecho to his tread, as light<br>
As when beneath the solemn oaks at eve<br>
The tricksy fairies in their revelry<br>
Wheel in wild dance, nor mark the dewy grass.<br>
Yet even now upon that chiselled brow,<br>
Lately so bright and fair, a Shadow dwells;<br>
It is the Ghost of Latin yet unlearnt,<br>
And dark forebodings of the Greek-to-come!<br>
What can his grief be? he has all he loves,<br>
A Scapula, an “Ainsworth’s Dictionary,”<br>
And “all the Greek, and all the Latin authors—”<br>
Then wherefore, moody boy, that crystal tear?<br>
“It is the thought,” methinks I hear him moan,<br>
Clasping with quivering hands his aching brow,<br>
“That certain Plays Euripides hath written<br>
Are lost, are lost, and <i>I</i> shall never see them!”</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Homer may come, and Homer may go,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>“And be shifted, like lumber, from shelf to shelf,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“But I will read no Greek, no Greek,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>“Until the Lost Dramas I’ve found for myself!”</p>

<p>Thus, all unconscious, rhymed his agony,<br>
Adapting to the anguish of the hour<br>
A fragment from our Poet Laureate.

<h3>Book II</h3>

<div class="verse">
<p>Sing ye, who list, the deeds of ancient might,<br>
In tournament, or deadlier battle-fray:<br>
Sing ye the havoc and the din of war,<br>
A nobler and a gentler theme be mine!<br>
Through twice nine years eventless passed his life,<br>
Save that each day some large addition brought<br>
To that vast mass of learning stored within.<br>
But now bright Fancy thrilled his raptured mind,<br>
And poised her wings for flight, yet ere she rose,<br>
With ponderous Sense he loaded her to Earth;<br>
And the full flood of Poesy within<br>
He primly tortured into wooden verse:</p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Glory of the ancient time,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>Classic fount of other days!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>How shall I, in modern rhyme<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>Fitly sing thy praise?<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It chanced, the other day,<br>
A tattered beggar asked an alms of me:<br>
“Bestow a trifle, sir, in charity!”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>I turned and said<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>“Good man,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>I have but sixpence in my purse<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>Yet rather than<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>In hunger you should pine,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And so your misery grow worse,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>It shall be thine,<br>
If you’ll be only good enough to say<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>That, in<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>Latin.”<br>
Was this encouragement to classic lore?<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>Say rather, more!<br>
So may my course for ever smoothly run,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>And onward swell<br>
In that smooth channel where it hath begun:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Still climbing, climbing up the classic heights<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>Where Fame doth dwell<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>And still<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>I will<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>From month to month, from week to week,<br>
Devote my drowsy days and wakeful nights<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>To Greek.”<br>
Such were the fancies of his lighter mood—<br>
His lighter mood, which very seldom came:<br>
But now my Muse, approaching higher themes,<br>
Shrinks from the task in trembling, for the field,<br>
Green &amp; smooth-shaven, spreads before her sight;<br>
The wickets pitched, the players ranged around;<br>
And he, the hero, in his glory there;<br>
A sight to dream of, not to write about!<br>
Then fare thee well, greatest of little men,<br>
In Greek, in Latin, in the cricket-field:<br>
Great as a bowler, greater as a bat,<br>
But as a “short slip” greater yet than that!
