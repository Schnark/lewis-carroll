<div class="verse">
<p><span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>From his shoulder Hiawatha<br>
Took the camera of rosewood,<br>
Made of sliding, folding rosewood;<br>
Neatly put it all together.<br>
In its case it lay compactly,<br>
Folded into nearly nothing;<br>
But he opened out the hinges,<br>
Pushed and pulled the joints and hinges,<br>
Till it looked all squares and oblongs,<br>
Like a complicated figure<br>
In the second book of Euclid.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>This he perched upon a tripod,<br>
And the family in order<br>
Sat before him for their pictures.<br>
Mystic, awful was the process.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>First, a piece of glass he coated<br>
With Collodion, and plunged it<br>
In a bath of Lunar Caustic<br>
Carefully dissolved in water:<br>
There he left it certain minutes.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Secondly, my Hiawatha<br>
Made with cunning hand a mixture<br>
Of the acid Pyro-gallic.<br>
And of Glacial Acetic,<br>
And of Alcohol and water:<br>
This developed all the picture.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Finally, he fixed each picture<br>
With a saturate solution<br>
<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-6">Of a certain salt of Soda—</span><br>
<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-7">Chemists call it Hyposulphite.</span><br>
(Very difficult the name is<br>
For a metre like the present,<br>
But periphrasis has done it.)<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>All the family in order<br>
Sat before him for their pictures.<br>
Each in turn, as he was taken,<br>
Volunteered his own suggestions,<br>
His invaluable suggestions.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>First the Governor, the Father:<br>
He suggested velvet curtains<br>
Looped about a massy pillar;<br>
And the corner of a table,<br>
Of a rosewood dining-table.<br>
He would hold a scroll of something,<br>
Hold it firmly in his left-hand;<br>
He would keep his right-hand buried<br>
(Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat;<br>
He would <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-8">contemplate</span> the <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-9">distance</span><br>
With a look of pensive meaning,<br>
As of ducks that die in tempests.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Grand, heroic was the notion:<br>
Yet the picture failed entirely:<br>
Failed, because he moved a little,<br>
Moved, because he couldn’t help it.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Next, his better half took courage;<br>
<i>She</i> would have her picture taken;<br>
She came dressed beyond description,<br>
Dressed in jewels and in satin<br>
Far too gorgeous for an empress.<br>
Gracefully she sat down sideways,<br>
With a simper scarcely human,<br>
Holding in her hand a nosegay<br>
Rather larger than a cabbage.<br>
All the while that she was taking,<br>
Still the lady chattered, chattered,<br>
Like a monkey in the forest.<br>
“Am I sitting still?” she asked him.<br>
“Is my face enough in profile?<br>
Shall I hold the nosegay higher?<br>
Will it come into the picture?”<br>
And the picture failed completely.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Next the Son, the Stunning-Cantab:<br>
He suggested curves of beauty,<br>
Curves pervading all his figure,<br>
Which the eye might follow onward,<br>
Till they centered in the breast-pin,<br>
Centered in the golden breast-pin.<br>
He had learnt it all from Ruskin<br>
(Author of ‘The Stones of Venice,<br>
‘Seven Lamps of Architecture,<br>
Modern Painters,’ and some others);<br>
And perhaps he had not fully<br>
Understood his author’s meaning;<br>
But, whatever was the reason,<br>
All was fruitless, as the picture<br>
Ended in an utter failure.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-10">Next to him</span> the eldest daughter:<br>
She suggested very little;<br>
Only <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-11">asked if he would take her</span><br>
With her look of ‘passive beauty.’<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Her idea of passive beauty<br>
Was a squinting of the left-eye,<br>
Was a drooping of the right-eye,<br>
Was a smile that went up sideways<br>
To the corner of the nostrils.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Hiawatha, when she asked him,<br>
Took no notice of the question,<br>
Looked as if he hadn’t heard it;<br>
But, when pointedly appealed to,<br>
Smiled in <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-12">his</span> peculiar manner,<br>
Coughed and said it ‘didn’t matter,’<br>
Bit his <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-13">lip</span> and changed the subject.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Nor in this was he mistaken,<br>
As the picture failed completely.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>So in turn the other <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-14">sisters.</span><br>
Last, the youngest son was <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-15">taken:</span><br>
Very rough and thick his hair was,<br>
Very round and red his face was,<br>
Very dusty was his jacket,<br>
Very fidgetty his manner.<br>
<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-16">And</span> his overbearing sisters<br>
Called him names he disapproved of:<br>
Called him Johnny, ‘Daddy’s Darling,’<br>
Called him Jacky, ‘Scrubby School-boy.’<br>
And, so <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-17">awful</span> was the picture,<br>
In comparison the others<br>
Might be thought to have succeeded,<br>
To have partially succeeded.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Finally my Hiawatha<br>
Tumbled all the tribe together,<br>
(‘Grouped’ is not the right expression,)<br>
And, as happy chance would have it,<br>
Did at last obtain a picture<br>
Where the faces all succeeded:<br>
Each came out a perfect likeness.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Then they joined and all abused it,<br>
Unrestrainedly abused it,<br>
As ‘the worst and ugliest picture<br>
<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-18">They could possibly have dreamed of.</span><br>
Giving one such strange expressions!<br>
Sulkiness, conceit, and meanness!<br>
Really any one would take us<br>
(Any one that did not know us)<br>
For the most unpleasant people!’<br>
(Hiawatha seemed to think so,<br>
Seemed to think it not unlikely.)<br>
All together rang their voices,<br>
Angry, loud, discordant voices,<br>
As of dogs that howl in concert,<br>
As of cats that wail in chorus.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>But my Hiawatha’s patience,<br>
His politeness, and his <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-19">patience</span>,<br>
Unaccountably had vanished,<br>
<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-20">And he left that happy party.</span><br>
Neither did he leave them slowly,<br>
With the calm deliberation,<br>
That intense deliberation<br>
Which photographers aspire to:<br>
But he left them in a hurry,<br>
Left them in a mighty <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-21">hurry</span>,<br>
<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-22">Vowing</span> that he would not stand it.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span><span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-23">Hurriedly he packed his boxes,</span><br>
Hurriedly the porter trundled<br>
On a barrow all his boxes;<br>
Hurriedly he took his ticket,<br>
Hurriedly the train received him:<br>
Thus departed Hiawatha.
