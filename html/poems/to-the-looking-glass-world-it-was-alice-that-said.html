<div class="verse">
<p>To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said<br>
“I’ve a sceptre in hand, I’ve a crown on my head.<br>
Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be,<br>
Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!”</p>

<p>Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,<br>
And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:<br>
Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea—<br>
And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three!</p>

<p>“O Looking-Glass creatures,” quoth Alice, “draw near!<br>
’Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear:<br>
’Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea<br>
Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!”</p>

<p>Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,<br>
Or anything else that is pleasant to drink;<br>
Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine—<br>
And welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine!
