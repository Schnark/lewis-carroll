<div class="verse">
<p>There was a Pig that sat alone<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Beside a ruined Pump:<br>
By day and night he made his moan—<br>
It would have stirred a heart of stone<br>
To see him wring his hoofs and groan,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Because he could not jump.</p>

<p>A certain Camel heard him shout—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A Camel with a hump.<br>
“Oh, is it Grief, or is it Gout?<br>
What is this bellowing about?”<br>
That Pig replied, with quivering snout,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Because I cannot jump!”</p>

<p>That Camel scanned him, dreamy-eyed.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Methinks you are too plump.<br>
I never knew a Pig so wide—<br>
That wobbled so from side to side—<br>
Who could, however much he tried,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Do such a thing as <i>jump</i>!</p>

<p>“Yet mark those trees, two miles away,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>All clustered in a clump:<br>
If you could trot there twice a day,<br>
Nor ever pause for rest or play,<br>
In the far future—Who can say?—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>You may be fit to jump.”</p>

<p>That Camel passed, and left him there,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Beside the ruined Pump.<br>
Oh, horrid was that Pig’s despair!<br>
His shrieks of anguish filled the air.<br>
He wrung his hoofs, he rent his hair,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Because he could not jump.</p>

<p>There was a Frog that wandered by—<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>A sleek and shining lump:<br>
Inspected him with fishy eye,<br>
And said “O Pig, what makes you cry?”<br>
And bitter was that Pig’s reply,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Because I cannot jump!”</p>

<p>That Frog he grinned a grin of glee,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And hit his chest a thump<br>
“O Pig,” said, “be ruled by me,<br>
And you shall see what you shall see.<br>
This minute, for a trifling fee,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>I’ll teach you how to jump!</p>

<p>“You may be faint from many a fall,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And bruised by many a bump:<br>
But, if you persevere through all,<br>
And practise first on something small,<br>
Concluding with a ten-foot wall,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>You’ll find that you <i>can</i> jump!”</p>

<p>That Pig looked up with joyful start:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Oh Frog, you <i>are</i> a trump!<br>
Your words have healed my inward smart—<br>
Come, name your fee and do your part:<br>
Bring comfort to a broken heart,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>By teaching me to jump!”</p>

<p>“My fee shall be a mutton-chop,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>My goal this ruined Pump.<br>
Observe with what an airy flop<br>
I plant myself upon the top!<br>
Now bend your knees and take a hop,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>For that’s the way to jump!”</p>

<p>Uprose that Pig, and rushed, full whack,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Against the ruined Pump:<br>
Rolled over like an empty sack,<br>
And settled down upon his back,<br>
While all his bones at once went ‘Crack!’<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>It was a fatal jump.</p>

<p>That Camel passed, as Day grew dim<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Around the ruined Pump.<br>
“O broken heart! O broken limb!<br>
It needs,” that Camel said to him,<br>
“Something more fairy-like and slim,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>To execute a jump!”</p>

<p>That Pig lay still as any stone,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And could not stir a stump:<br>
Nor ever, if the truth were known,<br>
Was he again observed to moan,<br>
Nor ever wring his hoofs and groan,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Because he could not jump.<br></p>

<p>That Frog made no remark, for he<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Was dismal as a dump:<br>
He knew the consequence must be<br>
That he would never get his fee—<br>
And still he sits, in miserie,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Upon that ruined Pump!
