<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-1">Only in <i>Phantasmagoria</i></aside><div class="continue"><div class="verse">
<p>In the dark silence of an ancient room,<br>
Whose one tall window fronted to the West,<br>
Where, through laced tendrils of a hanging vine,<br>
The sunset-glow was fading into night,<br>
Sat a pale Lady, resting weary hands<br>
Upon a great clasped volume, and her face<br>
Within her hands. Not as in rest she bowed,<br>
But large hot tears were coursing down her cheek,<br>
And her low-panted sobs broke awefully<br>
Upon the sleeping echoes of the night.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Soon she <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-2">unclasp’d</span> the volume once again,<br>
And read the words in tone of agony,<br>
As in self-torture, weeping as she read:—</p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-2">unclasped</aside>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">“He crowns the glory of his race:<br>
He prayeth but in some <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-3">fit</span> place<br>
To meet his foeman face to face:</span></p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-3">fair</aside>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">“And, battling for the True, the Right,<br>
From ruddy dawn to purple night,<br>
To perish in the midmost fight:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">“<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-4">Where hearts are fierce and hands are strong,</span><br>
<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-5">Where peals the bugle loud and long,</span><br>
Where blood is dropping in the throng:</span></p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-4">Where foes are fierce and weapons strong,</aside>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-5">Where roars the battle loud and long,</aside>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">“Still, with a dim and glazing eye,<br>
To watch the tide of victory,<br>
To hear in death the battle-cry:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">“Then, gathered grandly to his grave,<br>
To rest among the true and brave,<br>
In holy ground, where yew-trees wave:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">“Where, from church-windows <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-6">sculptured</span> fair,<br>
Float out upon the evening air<br>
The note of praise, the voice of prayer:</span></p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-6">“carven” in <i>Phantasmagoria</i></aside>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">“Where no vain marble mockery<br>
Insults with loud and boastful lie<br>
The simple soldier’s memory:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">“Where sometimes little children go,<br>
And read, in <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-7">whisper’d</span> accent slow,<br>
The name of him who sleeps below.”</span></p>
<aside class="toggle variant" id="annotation-7">whispered</aside>

<p>Her voice died out: like one in dreams she sat.<br>
“Alas!” she sighed. “For what can Woman do?<br>
Her life is aimless, and her death unknown:<br>
Hemmed in by social forms she pines in vain.<br>
Man has his work, but what can Woman do?”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And answer came there from the creeping gloom,<br>
The creeping gloom that settled into night:<br>
“Peace! For thy lot is other than a man’s:<br>
His is a path of thorns: he beats them down:<br>
He faces death: he wrestles with despair.<br>
Thine is of roses, to adorn and cheer<br>
His <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-8">lonely life</span>, and hide the thorns in flowers.”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>She spake again: in bitter tone she spake:<br>
“Aye, as a toy, the puppet of an hour,<br>

Or a fair posy, newly plucked at morn,<br>
But flung aside and withered ere the night.”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And answer came there from the creeping gloom,<br>
The creeping gloom that blackened into night:<br>
“So shalt thou be the lamp to light his path,<br>
What time the shades of sorrow close around.”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And, so it seemed to her, an awful light<br>
Pierced slowly through the darkness, orbed, and grew,<br>
Until all passed away—the ancient room—<br>
The sunlight dying through the trellised vine—<br>
The one tall window—all had passed away,<br>
And she was standing on the mighty hills.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Beneath, around, and far as eye could see,<br>
Squadron on squadron, stretched opposing hosts,<br>
Ranked as for battle, mute and motionless.<br>
Anon a distant thunder shook the ground,<br>
The tramp of horses, and a troop shot by—<br>
Plunged headlong in that living sea of men—<br>
Plunged to their death: back from that fatal field<br>
A scattered handful, fighting hard for life,<br>
Broke through the serried lines; but, as she gazed,<br>
They shrank and melted, and their forms grew thin—<br>
Grew pale as ghosts when the first morning ray<br>
Dawns from the East—the trumpet’s brazen blare<br>
Died into silence—and the vision passed—<br>
Passed to a room where sick and dying lay<br>
In long, sad line—there brooded Fear and Pain—<br>
Darkness was there, the shade of Azrael’s wing.<br>
But there was one that ever, to and fro,<br>
Moved with light footfall: purely calm her face,<br>
And those deep steadfast eyes that starred the gloom:<br>
Still, as she went, she ministered to each<br>
Comfort and counsel; cooled the fevered brow<br>
With softest touch, and in the listening ear<br>
Of the pale sufferer whispered words of peace.<br>
The dying warrior, gazing as she passed,<br>
Clasped his thin hands and blessed her. Bless her too,<br>
Thou, who didst bless the merciful of old!<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>So prayed the Lady, <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-9">watching tearfully</span><br>
<span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-10">Her gentle moving onward, till the night</span><br>
Had veiled her wholly, and the vision passed.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Then once again the <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-11">solemn</span> whisper came:<br>
“So in the darkest path of man’s despair,<br>
Where War and Terror shake the troubled earth,<br>
Lies woman’s mission; with unblenching brow<br>
To pass through scenes of <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-12">horror</span> and affright<br>
Where men grow sick and tremble: unto her<br>
All things are sanctified, for all are good.<br>
Nothing so mean, but shall deserve her care:<br>
Nothing so great, but she may bear her part.<br>
No life is vain: each hath his place assigned:<br>
Do thou thy task, and leave the rest to <span class="annotated variant" data-ref="annotation-13">God</span>.”<br>
And there was silence, but the Lady made<br>
No answer, save one deeply-breathed “Amen.”<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And she arose, and in that darkening room<br>
Stood lonely as a spirit of the night—<br>
Stood calm and fearless in the gathered night—<br>
And raised her eyes to heaven. There were tears<br>
Upon her face, but in her heart was peace,<br>
Peace that the world nor gives nor takes away!
