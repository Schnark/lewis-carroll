<h3>I.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>Dreaming of apples on a wall,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>And dreaming often, dear,<br>
I dreamed that, if I counted all,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>How many would appear?
</p></div>

<h3>II.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>A stick I found, that weighed two pound:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>I sawed it up one day<br>
In pieces eight, of equal weight.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>How much did each piece weigh?<br>
</p></div>

<p><small>[Everybody says “a quarter of a pound,” which is wrong.]</small></p>

<h3>III.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>John gave his brother James a box:<br>
About it there were many locks.</p>

<p>James woke, and said it gave him pain;<br>
So gave it back to John again.</p>

<p>The box was not with lid supplied,<br>
Yet caused two lids to open wide:</p>

<p>And all these locks had never a key—<br>
What kind of a box, then, could it be?
</p></div>

<h3>IV.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>What is most like a bee in May?<br>
“Well, let me think: perhaps—” you say.<br>
Bravo! You’re guessing well to-day!
</p></div>

<h3>V.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>Three sisters at breakfast were feeding the cat.<br>
The first gave it sole—Puss was grateful for that:<br>
The next gave it salmon—which Puss thought a treat:<br>
The third gave it herring—which Puss wouldn’t eat.
</p></div>

<p><small>[Explain the conduct of the cat.]</small></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p>Said the Moon to the Sun,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Is the daylight begun?”<br>
Said the Sun to the Moon,<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>“Not a minute too soon.”</p>

<p>“You’re a Full Moon,” said he.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>She replied, with a frown,<br>
“Well! I never <i>did</i> see<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>So uncivil a clown!”
</p></div>

<p><small>[<i>Query</i>. Why was the moon so angry?]</small></p>

<h3>VII.</h3>
<p>When the King found that his money was nearly all gone, and that he really <i>must</i> live more economically, he decided on sending away most of his Wise Men. There were some hundreds of them—very fine old men, and magnificently dressed in green velvet gowns with gold buttons: if they <i>had</i> a fault, it was that they always contradicted one another when he asked for their advice—and they certainly ate and drank <i>enormously</i>. So, on the whole, he was rather glad to get rid of them. But there was an old law, which he did not dare to disobey, which said that there must always be

<p>“Seven blind of both eyes:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Ten blind of one eye:<br>
Five that see with both eyes:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 1em;"></span>Nine that see with one eye.”
</p></div></div>

<p><small>[<i>Query</i>. How many did he keep?]</small></p>

</article>
<footer><p>Solutions (by “Eadgyth”, Carroll might have seen, approved, and perhaps improved them):</p>

<p><b>I.</b></p>

<div><div class="verse">
<p>If ten the number dreamed of, why ’tis clear<br>
That in the dream ten apples would appear.
</p></div></div>

<p><b>II.</b></p>

<div><div class="verse">
<p>In Shylock’s bargain for the flesh, was found<br>
No mention of the blood that flowed around;<br>
So when the stick was sawed in pieces eight,<br>
The sawdust lost diminished from the weight.
</p></div></div>

<p><b>III.</b></p>

<div><div class="verse">
<p>As curly-wigg’d Jemmy was sleeping in bed<br>
His brother John gave him a blow on the head;<br>
James opened his eyelids, and spying his brother,<br>
Doubled his fist, and gave him another.<br>
This kind of box then is not so rare;<br>
The lids are the eyelids, the locks are the hair;<br>
And as every schoolboy can tell to his cost,<br>
The key to the tangles is constantly lost.
</p></div></div>

<p><b>IV.</b></p>

<div><div class="verse">
<p>’Twixt “Perhaps” and “May be”<br>
Little difference we see:<br>
Let the question go round,<br>
The answer is found.
</p></div></div>

<p><b>V.</b></p>

<div><div class="verse">
<p>That salmon and sole Puss should think very grand<br>
Is no such remarkable thing,<br>
For more of these dainties Puss took up her stand:<br>
But when the third sister stretched out her fair hand<br>
Pray why should Puss swallow her ring?
</p></div></div>

<p><b>VI.</b></p>

<div><div class="verse">
<p>“In these degenerate days,” we oft hear said,<br>
“Manners are lost, and chivalry is dead!”<br>
No wonder, since in high exalted spheres<br>
The same degeneracy, in fact, appears.</p>

<p>The Moon in social matters interfering,<br>
Scolded the Sun, when early in appearing;<br>
And the rude Sun, her gentle sex ignoring,<br>
Called her a fool, thus her pretensions flooring.
</p></div></div>

<p><b>VII.</b></p>

<div><div class="verse">
<p>Five seeing, and seven blind,<br>
Give us twelve in all, we find;<br>
But all of these, ’tis very plain,<br>
Come into account again.<br>
For take notice, it may be true,<br>
That those blind of one eye are blind for two;<br>
And consider contrariwise,<br>
That to see with your eye you may have your eyes;<br>
So setting one against the other—<br>
For a mathematician no great bother—<br>
And working the sum, you will understand<br>
That sixteen wise men still trouble the land.
