<div class="verse">
<p>They both make a roaring—a roaring all night,<br>
They both are a fisherman-father’s delight,<br>
They are both, when in fury, a terrible sight!</p>

<p>The First nurses tenderly three little hulls<br>
To the lullaby-music of shrill-screaming gulls<br>
And laughs when they dimple his face with their skulls.</p>

<p>The Second’s a tidyish sort of a lad,<br>
Who behaves pretty well to a man he calls “Dad,”<br>
And earns the remark “Well, he isn’t so bad!”</p>

<p>Of the two put together, oh what shall I say?<br>
’Tis a time when “to live” means the same as “to play”<br>
When the busiest person does nothing all day:</p>

<p>When the grave College Don, full of lore inexpressi-<br>
ble, puts it all by, and is forced to confess he<br>
Can think but of Agnes and Evey——.
