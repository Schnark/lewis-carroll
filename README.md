This repository contains my (almost really) complete collection of the works of Lewis Carroll, see https://schnark.github.io/lewis-carroll/html/index.html

The root dir has the LaTeX source as well as the generated PDF.

The HTML files generated from LaTeX are in `html`.

The images, used both in LaTeX as well as in HTML, are in `images`, other HTML resources in `res`.

The code to generate the HTML files is mainly in `latex-to-html`, the diff file for manual fixes as well as the scripts to handle it are in `build-html`.
